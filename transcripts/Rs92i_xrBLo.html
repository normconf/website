        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=0">I am a data science consultant, especially doing NLP these days, along with a bunch of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=7">other data science-y problems. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=11">I also used to do data visualization and in fact ran a conference called OpenVizConf a </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=17">few years ago, which was less well organized than this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=21">So kudos to you guys. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=23">I have also been a professor at various points, but talk about a difficult job. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=31">And these days I do a lot with creative AI, which my newsletter reflects as well. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=36">So I work part-time with Google Arts and Culture and other clients. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=41">And I'm going to talk a little bit about some of them today, because I've had some interesting </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=44">problems with them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=47">I've got a lot in this deck, and I'm probably going to go kind of fast. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=51">I'm not going to spend a ton of time on the code examples. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=54">But having been a professor, I believe solidly in giving code examples, and I spend a lot </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=60">of my days looking for them online. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=62">So there's going to be a bunch of code, including stuff I'm not going to cover in my repo, that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=68">will be linked from these slides. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=70">So you can find how to do things from that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=75">And this is the essential plan. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=78">The last one, Misk Life Tips, is some of the tools I use that helped me solve some of the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=84">problems I'm going to show today. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=87">And we may not get to it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=91">We'll see. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=93">So I'm going to use today a bunch of data related to text to image. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=100">So unless you're living under a rock, you know about these models where you can type </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=104">in a phrase of what you want to see, and then you get an image out at the end. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=109">Stable diffusion is the most popular open source model. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=113">And there are a bunch of repos of prompts that people have typed in, including this </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=119">one, which is Lexica. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=121">So I'm going to use a sample of these for some of my examples today, just so you know </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=126">what's coming. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=130">The first technique I want to talk about is called UMAP, which is a data visualization </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=134">technique. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=135">This is incredibly useful for exploratory analysis. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=139">I've been using this technique of dimensionality reduction for a while. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=144">And before it was UMAP, it was T-S-N-E, which people call t-S-N-E, which drives me nuts </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=150">for some reason. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=151">But anyway, we've got UMAP now, which is a little bit better, although related, as papers </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=155">have shown. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=157">And it's something that allows you to get a glimpse of your data, big picture text data, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=164">and really impresses clients, just as a side note. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=169">This is an old, not very pretty or sexy picture that I made using T-S-N-E. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=177">This is a word to Vec embedding of a bunch of poetry on Gutenberg books. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=184">So open source poetry. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=185">Allison Parrish collected all of this and turned it into a corpus that people use for </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=191">various creative text projects. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=193">I was using it for a talk a few years ago, and then later was using the same corpus for </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=199">a text generation project. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=201">And the first thing I did was this T-S-N-E display of that poetry colored by date. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=208">So this is words, not sentences, embedded using Word2Vec. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=213">And then I mean, it's a blob. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=216">It's not like a good separation of anything. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=220">But the coloring and the sort of shape of it helped me discover something that I had </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=225">suspected when I was playing with the data in a generation algorithm. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=230">In particular, this blob on the lower left is like archaic, Latin, old English types </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=236">of things, which basically were screwing up a lot of my output in this project. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=241">And having made this picture and done this color coding, I was able to clean the dataset </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=246">to turn it into something a little bit more modern, which is what I actually needed. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=250">So this was a tremendously useful display for me at the time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=256">I do this all the time still. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=258">Now frequently it's with sentences or in this case prompts. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=262">So this is prompts in this online dataset that I'm going to be talking about, where </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=269">basically in this case I was looking at a subset with I think the word body was the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=276">subset that I picked for reasons that will become clear. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=280">And I did this interactive display so that I could take a look at how was the word body </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=286">appearing in these prompts. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=289">And in particular, is it a bad use? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=292">Because I was interested in not safe for work content detection. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=297">Making these interactive things like the little GIF I just showed is actually incredibly easy </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=302">these days. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=303">The tools are just getting better and better. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=306">It's very easy with sentence transformers to just pick whatever model you want. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=312">Body prompts in this code example is just all of the text strings that have the word </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=317">body in them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=319">We do our model encoding. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=321">Then we run it through UMAP, which is this dimensionality reduction algorithm that Leland </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=326">McKinnis published. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=328">And that gets us XY coordinates, a two dimensional matrix, which we can turn into an interactive </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=335">plot. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=336">Doing the interactive plot code is actually surprisingly easy. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=339">I mean, I'll put this in my repo. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=341">But basically we're going to use this library called Bokeh. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=345">And the thing that's cool about this library in particular is that you can either output </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=349">in your notebook, in your Jupyter notebook, or you can make a file. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=353">And the file is self-contained. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=355">So you can send it to a client or show it later or save it in your repo. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=359">And it's fully interactive where you can mouse over the text and see what the text is. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=366">So you can put HTML on the tooltips if you want. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=369">So that's that little hand symbol that you see there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=375">That's me putting some HTML in. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=377">So it's really, really easy. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=381">This is another couple of examples. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=383">This is a different dataset where I was looking at the use of the word blood in these prompts </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=388">because I was concerned about whether blood was being used in a really gory way or whether </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=394">it was just sort of generic. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=396">And it turned out, actually, that very few of them were really gory. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=400">A lot of it was very generic. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=402">So in particular, down at the very bottom is a lot of references here to blood moon, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=407">which is just a phrase, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=409">It's not especially about blood. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=414">So one of the things I end up doing a lot with these plots is sort of a crappy labeling </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=420">where I basically outline what's happening where on the plot in terms of content. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=428">This is painful. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=430">And involves, you know, doing sort of XY coordinates, getting an average, or just doing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=437">it by hand. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=438">So this over here on the right is one where I took this is a bunch of books, and I did </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=446">various averaging over the books for genre purposes. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=450">And the authors are the color coding here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=453">And then I went into Photoshop and I did a really, really careful labeling job with all </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=458">the content. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=459">So that takes a long time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=460">And I mean, hopefully the tools for doing this are going to get better and better. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=464">The libraries for doing this are getting better and better. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=467">It's super powerful when it's presented nicely. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=473">And the interactive side of it is very cool, too. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=475">So you might have seen this thing from Nomic AI, which is actually Ben Schmidt, who's a </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=480">digital humanities guy who's essentially a data viz genius. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=484">He did this thing with all of these prompts from CREA.ai's stable diffusion search engine. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=491">It's very cool. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=492">All right. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=494">So relatedly, our previous speaker, Vincent Warmerdon, he's been working on a tool called </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=499">bulk that supports selecting from one of these in order to do labeling or to help with labeling </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=506">in a kind of weak supervision method, which I had been doing before. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=510">So as soon as he released this library, I sent him like six issues of feature requests. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=515">And then Leland McInnis, the UMAP guy, is also working on a library called this.that, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=520">which might actually end up being better for data viz artifact creation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=523">I don't know. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=524">I haven't had time to dig into it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=526">But it looks like it's really cool. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=529">So that's essentially one of my main tips is like if you do these displays, which are </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=535">not actually hard to make anymore, you can get a whole lot of mileage out of them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=541">They're fun and people like them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=543">And you can make them look really good. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=546">Okay. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=547">So leaving behind the fun and not hard to make, let's talk about like real entity recognition </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=555">issues in the wild. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=557">I've had two client issues this past year that are that raised so many issues around </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=564">the tooling and the decision making and the design of these problems in this problem space. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=571">So here's one of the client problems. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=573">Suppose you want to see trends in searches in these prompts. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=579">So you have prompts like you see here from Lexica where people are visualizing content, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=585">like in this case, castles, and they're putting in names of artists that they're interested </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=590">in using as sort of inspirations. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=593">We all know that this is like a vexed issue in terms of artist citations. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=597">So suppose you want to track who's being used in these artist names. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=602">Well, that's an entity recognition problem, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=606">It's also kind of hard for various reasons. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=609">I mean, right out of the box, it looks like it ought to be easy. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=613">But here's why it gets hard. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=615">So I took 80,000 stable diffusion prompts and the repo link is shown there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=622">There's much bigger sets out there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=623">But for the purpose of this talk, I didn't want to use a big set. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=628">Went through Spacey, a natural language processing library, and got these totals. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=636">So right away, you can see the ones in red are essentially the same artist. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=644">Art germ, art germ, Stanley, art germ, it would be probably in quotes there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=652">So like this is one of those immediate questions that you hit immediately when you do one of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=658">these projects, which is what do we do about that? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=662">I want to point out for people who know about using databases of entities to disambiguate </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=668">or to link, a lot of these artists aren't in Wikipedia. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=672">You have to go to other places to get any kind of canonical reference ID or page for </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=677">them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=679">So yeah. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=682">The thing that comes up quickly with this kind of project is what are you going to do </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=686">with these? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=687">Like, what do you care about when you want to look for entities like that? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=692">So for instance, this is Mastodon's Spark lines showing trending terms, hashtags on </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=701">one of the servers. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=703">So in this case, like, probably they don't care at Mastodon, but we might care from an </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=709">NLP or data science perspective. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=710">Do we care that people don't know what the right term is? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=713">So for the natural language conference, EMNLP, do we care that people are using both EMNLP </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=719">2022 and without the 2022? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=723">Should those be in some sense merged or not? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=726">So this is essentially an entity resolution problem. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=730">And the other question is, like, do you want to know the truth about what people are typing? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=735">Or do you want to know what, like, do you want to know what they're actually typing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=738">in terms of how they type it out, the string, including mistakes? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=744">Or how they refer to our term? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=746">Do they know that it's Stanley Lau? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=748">And so all these questions come up quickly about, like, what is truth and what are you </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=753">going to be accurate with respect to in the data? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=757">You hit these problems immediately with this kind of project. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=761">So like I said, entity resolution is what we're talking about here, where we're usually </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=766">talking about techniques that sort of identify, group, and link things to some object in the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=773">real world. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=774">So there is some artist who is Art Germ, and how do we talk about him? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=779">Or how do people talk about him? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=781">And do we care about the differences in how they talk about him or not? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=785">So that's where the UI and the sort of system design part of it comes in. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=790">This is a huge topic of research and of tooling and companies have solutions, et cetera. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=798">I'm a person. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=799">I'm not a company. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=800">Well, I am technically. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=801">But you know what I mean. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=803">So you end up doing research on, like, what are the best ways to deal with this? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=808">You've only got a certain number of hours or days for the client or whatever. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=814">There's a bunch of papers and links that you can follow on this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=818">But some of the issues that you're going to come up with, you've done your named entity </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=821">recognition. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=822">You've got in that data, you've got misspellings or orthographic variants that you found. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=827">Like Leonardo da Vinci might be written in any number of ways. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=831">There might be misspellings, like Leonardo da Vinci. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=837">Looks like probably they're trying to refer to the same person. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=841">Maybe not in some cases. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=844">And then we have things like name and label variants that are all true but are different. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=847">So this comes up a lot in researching things related to women's names. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=853">So Mrs. Smith, Mrs. John Smith, Pamela Smith, Mae Austin, these are all potentially the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=859">same person. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=861">They're referred to, unfortunately, with a man's name in some cases. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=864">So your entity resolution situation has to handle these, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=871">Then there's misrecognitions of the model. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=875">So for instance, Mary's, it's actually Mary that's the entity, but this particular spacing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=882">model I was using often had an apostrophe S merged in with the token. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=888">Coreference. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=890">So this is essentially another problem that sometimes clients care about and sometimes </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=895">they don't. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=896">So Barry the bat was a fun guy. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=897">Barry partied all night. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=899">Barry the bat and Barry are referring to the same entity with different strings. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=904">So this is also classic with full names in journalism and then you use the last name </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=910">to refer to somebody. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=913">So sometimes clients want those merged and sometimes they don't. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=918">You need a coreference detector to handle that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=921">Or crappy heuristics, which is what I end up doing a lot. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=925">All right. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=926">So tooling to handle this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=927">So if you're just interested in counting and merging things, there's a whole bunch of tools </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=934">out there that I've used a lot. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=936">One of them is the string grouper tool, which has various algorithms for how it tries to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=942">merge strings that might be the same. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=945">So it's a cool repo. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=948">I recommend looking at it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=951">And you can do things like get what the similarity threshold is, use different algorithms, et </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=957">cetera. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=958">So what essentially you're seeing here is I've run this thing over my list of artists </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=964">or names from that data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=967">And on the left is the original string and on the right it says right name. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=971">That's the first mention in the group that it made that it's saying these are all probably </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=976">the same thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=977">So you can see down at the bottom, Krenz Koshart, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=983">They're all basically the same. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=986">Now you're going to find that you have errors in your data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=991">So those are the apostrophe S's, et cetera. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=994">Some of them are just bad. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=995">You might want to use a different tool. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=999">So here we're looking at like a combined list of who are the biggest groups. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1004">So Greg Rutkowski, Franz Puka had the biggest number of different variants, et cetera. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1012">Notice that not all of these are artists, some of them are content of the image like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1016">Emma Watson. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1017">So do you care is the question. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1023">So some of these things also have to be done by hand. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1027">So for instance, for big string differences, things like Price Waterhouse Cooper, PwC is </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1032">a valid way of referring to it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1034">So you have to actually create a dictionary that says this is a thing that also is this </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1039">thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1041">So the by hand thing is super vexed. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1046">You have to do this a lot, it turns out. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1047">So James Jean and James Dean are not the same person. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1050">One is an actor and one is an artist. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1053">But string similarity would say that they should be grouped together and you're going </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1058">to have to manage that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1060">So you end up doing a ton of by hand stuff and maintaining databases and sort of lists </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1067">of entities. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1068">It's just a problem in this space that you have to do that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1074">And the tooling around this isn't superb. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1077">I just end up in dictionaries and lists a lot. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1083">It's a big problem. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1084">One of the I'm going to skip this and move on to the next example. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1088">So one of the tools that I use actually, this is very norm conf, is OpenRefine. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1093">So this is a GUI tool for helping you deal with data problems and sort of merge them </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1099">and manage them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1102">This is a great tool because I can just decide in this label, like right there in the list, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1108">how do I want to call that group and fix the string labeling issues. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1115">It requires a number of steps. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1116">And essentially what you want to do is you do this cluster and edit thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1121">And I recommend a sort of a workflow where you keep the original entity over in another </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1127">column and then you work off this column and then you end up with a mapping so that you </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1131">can use them later in a tool. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1135">All right. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1136">So wow. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1137">I'm definitely not going to get through all my slides. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1139">I knew this was coming. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1141">So basically you'll be able to manage a dictionary of the original and the merged and export </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1147">the data and deal with it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1150">One of the things, one of the reasons I want to talk about that is because dealing with </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1156">rules is actually a big thing in NLP, at least in my world of NLP. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1161">You end up having to augment models with rules quite a lot. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1165">So, so, Spacy has a bunch of tools for helping you deal with this because you can write patterns </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1172">and define rules that you can use as part of your pipeline in Spacy, which is super </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1178">useful. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1180">So the entity ruler in particular allows you to say that this art germ version is also </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1186">this art germ version with an ID. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1190">There's a whole bunch of docs and tooling around this that you can look at. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1195">So I'm now going to switch to this body prompts issue and the not safe for work classification </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1201">problem that I was working on for one client. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1204">So say you have 8 million unlabeled examples and you're trying to work on a not safe for </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1209">work porn classifier for these prompts. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1213">It turns out that one of the things that some of the moderators dealing with this data were </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1219">looking at was mentions of porn stars. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1223">It turned out that that was actually not a bad idea. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1225">And in fact, in a lot of the cleaned up repos of this kind of data, the porn stars are still </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1231">in there because nobody thought of ruling them out as content problems. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1237">So for instance, in this data set I was looking at. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1240">And let's talk about why that is. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1242">So the text itself is not bad, but the output image will probably be bad because it's been </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1249">trained on photos of porn stars. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1252">So this is like, I was like, okay, this is an obvious gazetteer problem. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1256">I just need a list of porn stars. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1259">Where am I going to get a list of porn stars? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1261">Well, it turns out Wikipedia is excellent at this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1264">Why might that be? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1265">Well, that's because an awful lot of editors of Wikipedia are white men. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1271">And so it's just a known fact that the Androzon women porn stars are amazing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1275">So this turns out to be a very good database for getting lists of porn stars. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1280">So Chris Alvin is talking later. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1283">Someone give him shit about this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1286">So what I did, and this is something that a tool like Spacey will allow you to do, is </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1292">you basically take a classifier that doesn't necessarily know enough about, say, porn stars, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1299">and you add them in as rules because you have this ability to do rules, and then you basically </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1304">can override the text classification in case it doesn't know about the porn star and say, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1309">this is actually bad stuff. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1313">So I've spent a bunch of time doing, like, these creative modifications of pipelines </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1318">in Spacey, and this is one of them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1320">So I'm here to tell you how to do that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1323">So basically all you have to do is define your own component that says, if I have a </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1329">label that's a porn person, I'm going to call that a positive classification for porn, regardless </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1336">of what the model did. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1338">And this is the crucial thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1340">It's like override the model and just don't allow it in this case. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1345">So you can get the code from my repo or from the slides, but basically we load in a trained </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1351">text cat model, and then we define our rules for all the porn people, and we say override </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1359">and use those rules for the porn person instead. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1362">This is just tremendously useful. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1364">So for instance, I can have coffee with Mia Khalifa in the coffee shop and come out with </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1370">these entities. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1371">One of them is a porn person, so the classification is definitely, like, this is not safe for </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1375">work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1376">Whereas, otherwise, if it's not a porn person, I get sort of ordinary entities, and then </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1381">I'm fine. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1384">I've learned a lot about doing really, really wacky things with Spacey pipelines, some of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1389">which would not be probably approved of by the Spacey explosion team, but basically here </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1395">we are. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1396">So a bunch of examples in my code in the repo. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1401">And I just want to wrap up. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1403">So Peter Baumgartner, who's also speaking later, has a great post about rules in NLP. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1410">And I mean, it's essentially the process you kind of want to go through is sort of this, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1415">which is you use rules to help yourself train a model, and then you review your errors, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1421">you fix and improve your model. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1423">This is fantastic, but also you might want to keep the rules around. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1427">So in this case, I mean, rules are fragile, and in this kind of context, you probably </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1432">want to have, like, absolutely call it porn or call it not safe for work if this name </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1440">comes up. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1441">You don't want to allow the model to be unsure. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1445">You just want to say this is blocked. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1449">There are a ton of Spacey resources. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1451">I have become an expert on digging through them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1454">You definitely want to use my list if you aren't up to date with how to use Spacey and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1460">how to learn among their tools. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1462">There's a lot of information sort of floating around. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1465">There's a giant scary flow chart, which I'll show you a glimpse of in a second, but it's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1470">very, very useful. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1471">They have a customized labeling tool, and essentially they're like great people, and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1476">two of them are speaking here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1478">So obviously they're excellent. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1481">This is only a part of the giant scary flow chart, but it is tremendously useful. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1488">Sorry to jump in, Lynn. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1490">It would be a shame if we didn't get to any questions. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1492">We've got a real quick one for you. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1494">Have you found that there are some sentence embedding models that work better out of the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1497">box for the purposes of UMAT? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1501">So I just try a bunch, because like I said, it's an exploratory method for me, so I just </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1507">try a few until I see if I can see clusters. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1510">But the problem is that with UMAP, you also have a bunch of different things you can control </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1516">in the settings. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs92i_xrBLo&t=1517">So you can end up iterating a lot until you get to the point that you like your picture. </a>
