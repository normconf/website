        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=0">This is the opposite of transformers. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=4">This is the Zen of tedium, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=7">or how I learned to stop worrying and love doing things the hard way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=13">First off, I got to get it out of the way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=16">There are some really valid reasons to avoid doing things the hard way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=20">The first of these is some things just take too long. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=25">When we take our pup to the vet, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=27">we like to walk her, weather permitting, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=30">and if she's not in a bad way, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=33">it's a nice stroll through the Boston Public Garden and down a tree-lined pedestrian mall. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=40">It takes longer and we might be a little sweaty and a little dirty when we get there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=46">But doing it the hard way is so much more satisfying than getting a car, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=51">popping in, popping out. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=53">But if I was going to check in at the home office in Sunnydale, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=58">I would not walk. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=60">However pleasant it might be, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=62">it would be too long, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=63">it would defeat the purpose. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=65">When we have code bases that are millions of lines long, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=70">or tables that have trillions of rows, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=73">a lot of times it's just not worth our while to do things the hard way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=77">That's a valid excuse. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=79">Another one is, we're going to push back on this later, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=84">but the flip side is sometimes, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=86">legitimately, I could be using my brain to solve more valuable problems. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=91">If my job is to copy and paste cells from </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=95">one spreadsheet to another spreadsheet in a similar way over and over again, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=102">I can legitimately argue that, hey, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=104">if I write a tool to automate this, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=107">then I can get it up and going and I could do things that might add </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=111">a little more value to the team, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=113">to the department, to the company. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=115">That's totally fair, totally legitimate thing to do. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=121">Another valid reason to avoid doing things the hard way is, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=125">sometimes we have to, it's part of playing the game. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=129">The high point of my Twitter career was this tweet right here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=133">It said, ML strategy tip. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=135">When you have a problem, build two solutions. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=139">One is a deep Bayesian transformer running on multi-Cloud Kubernetes, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=143">and the other is a SQL query built on a stack of egregiously oversimplifying assumptions. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=148">You put one on your resume and the other in production and everybody's happy. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=153">There is sometimes a justification for doing things the fancy way, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=159">the automated way, the slick way, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=161">for your promotion packet or </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=163">for your next position that you're trying to get hired for. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=166">I don't like it, but it's the truth. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=170">Now, there are, got to call out, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=173">there are some less than valid reasons to avoid doing things the hard way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=178">The first of these is the fallacy that doing a thing manually is a moral failing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=186">Picture that you have a service or something that you're </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=190">in charge of making sure it's healthy and running. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=192">So you get a few metrics like how long it takes to return a response, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=198">what fraction of the time it's up, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=200">what the volume of requests are that it's getting. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=202">You make a little dashboard that you can track these things day to day. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=206">You have a nice visual heartbeat health monitor right there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=211">One approach is you sit down at your desk every morning, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=215">you pull these things up, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=216">you scroll through them, you take a look, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=217">and you get a feeling that yes, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=219">everything is working as it should. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=222">Some misguided souls will tell you, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=225">hey, we don't do things every day. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=229">We're engineers. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=231">We write tools for that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=232">We automate that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=234">Sure enough, there are tools that you can go in and set alerts. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=238">So if any of those limits are to fall too low or go too high, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=242">you can set an alert for that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=244">If any of them change too much in one day, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=246">you can set an alert for that too. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=248">You can even get fancy and if two or three of them change in </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=252">some concerted pattern that is worrying for some reason, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=256">you can set an alert for that too. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=258">Then you turn the thing on and forget about it and walk away. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=264">Life is good. You've solved the problem. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=266">Now, when you do that, there are three things that could happen. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=270">One is you get some alerts that something went wrong, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=276">and you go and you open it up, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=277">and you realize, well, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=280">yeah, sure, that one was high, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=282">but it was a Saturday and it was World Cup. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=285">We'd expect that one to be high. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=287">Not really a problem. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=289">Another thing that can happen is you don't get an alert, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=293">but you hear from a very disgruntled VP a few days later, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=298">what's wrong, and you go and you look and you're like, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=301">oh, no, I see what happened. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=305">I didn't think to set an alert for </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=307">exactly this set of circumstances, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=310">but if I had been looking for it, I would have seen it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=313">The third thing that can happen is </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=315">your system that does this automated alert check can silently fail, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=320">and then you don't know if your service is healthy or not. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=323">You've got nothing. You're flying blind. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=326">Now, there are engineering solutions to all of these things. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=330">They're not unsolvable, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=332">but don't fall for the trap that there's an easy solution to wrap this up. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=337">Especially, don't fall for the line that it's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=341">wrong to pop it open and look at it with your own eyeballs every morning. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=348">Another mistaken belief is that manual tasks are beneath me, beneath any of us. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=355">No, I'm not going to do it the hard way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=358">Do you know what my title is? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=359">There are other people who do that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=360">We have contractors who do that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=361">We have grad students do that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=363">Sorry, grad students. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=365">We have people who somehow are suited to that and should do that, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=371">because I shouldn't have to worry about it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=373">I build models. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=374">I deploy things in production. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=376">I call bullshit. Any job that needs to be done is fair game for any of us. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=385">Yes, we specialize. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=386">Some things take a long time to get comfortable with, that's fine. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=390">But if sweeping the floor is what needs to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=392">happen to get the product out the door, then we sweep the floor. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=395">If you like to eat, you learn to cook. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=399">If you like to build models, you spend time labeling data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=402">You don't assume that someone is going to take care of those dirty details for you. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=408">Finally, this one can bring up feelings, busyness. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=414">When you sit down to do a task the hard way, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=418">often there's a repetitive nature to it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=421">Our apex executive functions aren't always needed for that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=426">We can set those offline. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=429">While we're paging through the documentation for our software tools, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=435">making sure all the functions are well-represented and properly typed, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=439">then that allows another part of our brain to kick back and say, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=445">oh, you know what, I'm so behind, I owe so many emails, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=451">and I need to review that paper, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=453">and I got to get that grant proposal in, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=455">and I need to write those letters of recommendation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=458">That's legitimate because most of us are oversubscribed. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=462">But the jump that's easy to make there is, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=467">therefore, I should not be spending time on this task. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=470">I shouldn't be doing it the hard way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=472">There's got to be a better way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=474">It should be automated, or it should be delegated, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=476">or something, like it shouldn't happen. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=479">I'm going to skip it. I'm going to find a way out. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=482">It's oftentimes like if we've got a task, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=486">the best direct path through it is just to take a deep breath and keep going. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=492">Do it the hard way, get it out of the way, then move on. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=497">Now, the busyness is a big problem, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=499">and the solution to that is do less stuff. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=505">And if you want to know about that, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=507">you'll have to come to the next NormConf, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=510">which I'm told will be in 2015. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=516">Now, there is a handful of reasons to love doing things the hard way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=522">So this same phenomenon of our apex cognitive functions, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=529">getting a break, is a bonus, because like any muscle, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=534">this thing gets tired. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=537">We have so many hours in the day, but brain hours, we have far fewer. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=543">Like if you're really good, you've got four, maybe five peak brain hours. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=548">I'm probably down to two. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=550">Like you only have so much that you can really work with. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=554">And so if you're doing something that's a little bit by the book, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=558">a little bit repetitive, checking the labels on your data set, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=562">you can let that part of your brain rest for an hour, 90 minutes. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=567">Then when you're done, you come out, you're ready to scheme and plan </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=570">and pitch and strategize, and you can jump right back in. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=577">Another one is flow. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=580">So when you get into a task that is a little bit repetitive </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=585">and has a little bit of a restricted domain, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=588">a beautiful thing can happen where it's like if your brain is a processor </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=593">and you have your L1 and your L2 cache, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=597">you can cache all of the concepts and the relationships and the connections </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=602">and just have them right there at your fingertips. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=604">And so it's almost at that point like you're spinning magic, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=607">like you don't have to go digging and dredging for these things. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=610">You're just like constructing it like Elsa with an ice castle, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=615">like you just have it right there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=618">When there's a good flow when I'm coding, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=624">it's one of the best feelings in the world. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=628">Now, I have strong feelings about large language models. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=632">When I'm coding, I feel like there's maybe a dozen paths ahead of me </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=637">at any given time, and the game is I'm thinking a couple steps forward </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=641">on each one, like, well, is this a good way to represent this? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=644">How might it play with this other part of the system? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=647">How might it play with this other part I'm planning to write in the future? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=651">And then I'll inch forward, write a line or two, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=654">and then I'll repeat that again, and there's this repeated fan, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=657">kind of a fractal fan out ahead of me. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=662">If I write an informative comment and use that as a prompt </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=667">to a large language model and it spits out a function for me, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=670">that's like it picks one road from beginning to end and says, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=674">use this, I'm confident that it's right. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=676">This is absolutely the way to do it, get obsessed. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=680">Now my thought process is totally hijacked. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=684">Instead, I'm evaluating at every tiny step, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=687">well, was this the right name for this variable? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=690">Was it the right type to assign to it? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=692">Did I want to put this in a function or maybe like abstract it out </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=696">or maybe just put a couple lines in line in this other function? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=700">But you're focused on this proposed path, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=704">which can entirely distract you from something else, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=706">and you're forced to switch context very quickly. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=709">It breaks flow. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=711">So this is an instance where for me, at least, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=713">doing it the hard way is a beautiful thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=718">Another benefit is sometimes it is faster. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=721">It is better use of time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=723">As always, Randall Monroe, XKCD, has our back on this, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=728">little back of the envelope calculation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=731">How often you do a task, how much time you're going to save off </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=734">if you automate it, and then if you plan to do this task for five years, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=740">how much time can you invest and break even? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=744">Nick HK on Twitter, he said we could use this tweet. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=747">He says, I stopped using a reference manager a few years ago </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=750">and just put together a bib by hand for each new paper. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=753">I don't really miss it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=755">Maintaining it was more work than it saved. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=759">My personal version of the bib file is I've got a laptop with Linux on it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=765">When I sit down at my desk, I like to plug it into a big monitor </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=767">so I can see all of my bright red errors much larger. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=772">Because Linux is what it is, it doesn't automatically detect the monitor, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=776">so I have to unplug it and plug it back in every time my laptop goes to sleep. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=783">Linux being what it is, I know that if I were to invest enough time, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=787">I could change the right config file or update the right driver, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=791">and it would fix the problem, automatically detect it like magic every time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=797">But doing some quick math on how long this takes and how many times I do it, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=802">even if I invested an hour in that task, it would take me years to pay it off. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=808">So I do it the hard way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=810">I just unplug it and plug it back in. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=812">I don't have to think about it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=813">It just happens. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=816">Related to this, doing things the hard way ensures focus. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=822">The myth on top, again, from Randall Munroe, I'm working on a task. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=827">Oh, I should automate this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=829">You write some code, automation takes over. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=832">Boom, free time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=833">You can meme that much more. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=837">In reality, you write the code, and you get a great 80% solution, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=843">and you're excited. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=846">Like, this is a legitimate win. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=849">This is OKR success. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=851">But you're still spending time on the original task. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=853">It's not very satisfying in that sense. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=856">So you rethink it, you refactor, you go back, you debug. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=860">You get it up to a 95% solution. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=862">Like, that's really good. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=864">That is an A level of effort. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=867">But you haven't gotten rid of the original task. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=869">You still have to monitor it, and you still </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=870">have to go back to it and take care of the other corner cases. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=874">So you're lying in your bed at 3 in the morning, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=876">you're staring at the ceiling, and you say, oh, I got it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=879">If I solve this previously unsolved computer science problem, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=883">I can get it up to five nines of completion, at which point I can walk away. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=887">And I had a flash of inspiration for how to do this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=892">And so you jump in with both feet, you work on this problem, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=896">you make a little headway, you publish a paper, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=898">you get recognized for it, you get a new position at another institution, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=902">and the original task is never touched again. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=905">And you live happily ever after. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=909">Maybe not what you're going for. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=910">The task is a failure. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=912">One of my favorites here is for doing things the hard way, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=917">sometimes there's no other way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=920">My favorite example of this is feature engineering. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=925">I have to give respect to the AutoML tools who take all the features </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=931">and in a lot of clever ways combine them to get plausibly engineered features </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=936">and test them for predictive power. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=938">But at the end of the day, there's too many possibilities. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=942">There's too many permutations, too many functions you can use to combine these things. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=946">There's no way you can automate all that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=949">And they often require knowing things that aren't in the data set. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=953">You have to know what you're measuring. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=955">You have to know how it interacts with the other pieces, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=958">often physically what's behind it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=961">Sometimes you have to know exactly the details of how it was measured. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=966">I had one situation where you actually had to know who made each measurement </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=970">so that you would know how to properly interpret it and make a good feature out of it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=975">There's no shortcut for that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=977">Doing it the hard way is the only way sometimes. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=983">And then finally, this is the last one, serendipity. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=988">It is totally valid when you need to get from point A to point B </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=993">to find the nearest on-ramp, blaze down the freeway, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=996">listen to some tunes, hop off the off-ramp, and you're there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1000">You're done. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1001">You saw some concrete and mission accomplished. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1006">But it's not the only way to do it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1009">Sometimes you can take the long way, you can take the slow way, the hard way, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1014">and go by some back roads. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1016">When you do, you'll see some things. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1019">In The Hobbit, Thorin Oakenshield says, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1023">there's nothing like looking if you want to find something. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1027">You certainly usually find something if you look, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1030">but it's not always quite the something you were after. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1033">Now, he said this to Fili and Kili, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1035">because they were getting rained on and danger of getting crushed to death by some giants. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1040">Fili and Kili went and found a dry cave, which was a win. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1044">Now, it happened to be a golf course, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1046">but it was a cave, which was a win. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1049">Now, it happened to be a goblin-infested cave in the Misty Mountains, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1052">and they got kidnapped, but everything turned out OK in the end. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1057">They found something, but it wasn't quite the something they were after, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1060">and they were the better for it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1064">My favorite example of this is when you get a new data set, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1068">so you have a CSV, pull up the data set or a manageable portion of it in a spreadsheet, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1075">just look at the columns. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1076">What are they labeled? Do they even make sense? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1078">Are there repeated names? Are there missing names? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1081">Are there entirely and utterly cryptic names? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1085">Look at the rows. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1086">Are there columns that have the same value for every row? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1089">Are there columns that are like 99% missing? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1092">Are there columns with states in the United States </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1095">where some are capitalized and some are not? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1098">Actually ran across that pretty recently. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1102">Are there columns that tend to be missing together </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1106">or tend to change in the same way together? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1110">Are there half a dozen different representations for missing values? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1114">Every single time I've done this, I've found things, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1119">seen things, found the answers to questions I didn't even think to ask. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1126">You'll find something. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1127">It won't always be quite the something you were after, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1129">but you'll find it and you'll be the better for it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1133">And in my experience, this getting elbows deep in the code, in the data, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1141">this is the path from competency to expertise. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1147">I hope that you find your own Zen of tedium and have a good time doing it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1beO_1a6xY&t=1153">Thank you. </a>
