        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=0">My name is Zachary Blackwood, and I am a senior data engineer at Snowflake, part of the Streamlet </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=7">team and acquisition. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=10">And I want to talk to you today about what it says on the screen, how to hack your way </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=14">to a better API. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=16">Hopefully not to get hacked, but that could be a risk that you face along the way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=24">So I suspect many of you have interesting stories for how you got into data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=32">I don't know how many of the people listening and watching are at what stage in their career </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=36">and how many people kind of had this vision that I want to be a data person, I want to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=41">do things with, I want to do machine learning and modeling, or at least I want to do computer </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=46">science. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=47">That was not at all my original plan. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=49">I actually began as a teacher, taught high school, various things. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=56">And eventually couldn't afford to do that anymore, sadly. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=61">And so I went to software. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=64">And one of the themes that I've noticed throughout my career as I've grown and as I've transitioned </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=73">is thinking, realizing this doesn't seem like it's working great. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=78">There's got to be a better way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=79">Even when I started teaching physics, I realized I went in not understanding a lot of fundamental </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=84">things even with a physics degree. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=85">And so I wanted to do better for my students than I had experienced. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=91">And so a lot of that shifted into last few years, I want to build better tools for data </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=97">related stuff. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=99">And in particular lately, I want to help build better data apps with working with Streamlet </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=105">and being at Snowflake helping to do that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=108">So I do some amount of data engineering on the pipelines and dbt models and things like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=114">that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=115">But I get to spend a lot of my time just playing around with Streamlet apps and trying to make </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=119">things work better, which is a lot of fun and has led me to this topic. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=125">I remember very distinctly beginning my very first software job, I was in a small startup </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=132">sitting in a room with a bunch of smart people having done zero professional programming </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=138">before. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=139">And basically, I would spend a few minutes, get stuck on something and turn around and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=144">ask ask the guy sitting behind me. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=147">And there was very smart and very patient and kind people sitting around me. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=150">And so I'm sure they got annoyed. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=153">But they did answer my questions. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=154">And slowly I got to learn more and more things about about what we were doing, ask fewer </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=159">questions or better questions. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=162">Eventually I learned there was this there was a way to ask those questions on the internet. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=167">And I got slightly better, you know, look for what is the specific error message or </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=171">error numbers and things like that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=172">What is the specific software that I'm using? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=175">Can I figure out what's actually causing the problem? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=177">And I got pretty good at googling things to find the solution. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=182">And for a long time, that was sufficient. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=185">But at a certain a few years in, we a new co worker came in and he just seemed to know </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=190">so many things about the software that we were using. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=194">And you know, and I've been working with it for a while and you how did how did you find </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=197">that out? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=198">Oh, well, I read it here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=199">Well, how did you find that out? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=200">I read it here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=201">And this is a guy who would actually read, he would read the peps for the new Python </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=205">features coming out. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=206">And he would just read the documentation for the tools we were using. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=210">And I finally finally after, you know, going to him again and again realized, oh, I should </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=216">start doing that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=217">So that that became kind of the next the next stage of my journey as a developer that was </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=224">slowly moving into the data world somewhat. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=228">But the kind of the last stage, which is really the thing I want to talk about today, and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=232">maybe 90% of you are here, but I hope there's a few of you who maybe are still at stage </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=236">two or three here is I actually realized as as someone who's working with software, I </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=243">can actually dig into the internals of the software that I'm using of the third party </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=247">tools that I'm using and get and actually can get a lot of value by doing that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=253">So I want to convince you today that the internals of the software that you're using may be more </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=258">accessible than you think. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=260">And that sometimes messing around with those internals is a good idea. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=266">So I want to talk about two particular kinds of messing around with internals that have </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=272">that have been very interesting and useful to me, particularly in the last few years. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=276">And the first one is monkey patching. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=280">So monkey patching, besides being a great, an excellent term, is is a broadly applicable </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=287">idea and various dynamic languages where you actually can replace some of the some of the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=293">code as as your code runs, you can actually replace some piece of code with another piece </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=298">of code, which turns out to be a pretty handy thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=302">I think I first was exposed to this idea with with writing, writing tests, and oh, well, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=307">we need to we need to pretend that API works this way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=311">And so just for the context of this test, we're going to swap out a little bit of code </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=315">to make it do something different, you know, not not hit a server and things like that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=320">So this is a this was a very surprising idea to me. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=323">I had no no intuition that if I, you know, said x dot something equals something else, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=329">that it would actually work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=330">But it turns out it did, which is a very interesting thing and opens up a lot of doors. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=336">Oftentimes, I and maybe you have the same question of, okay, why is this package broken? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=342">Or maybe more often, why doesn't it do the thing that I want it to do? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=347">Why doesn't it work the way I want it to work? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=349">And I need it to work for this particular this particular instance. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=356">And before we get into too far into the internals, the wonderful thing if you have a either a </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=362">modern, modern IDE or an ancient IDE with some modern plugins, it's very, you can very </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=368">quickly get access to things like here's the doc string for this method, you can find it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=375">all sorts of things. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=376">No, this is very basic kind of thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=377">But this is where often it all starts. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=379">And sometimes it all ends like, oh, now I understand why it does what it does. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=384">I understand I was using it in the wrong way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=386">Or, oh, it actually does support it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=388">It just has this extra argument that I didn't realize. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=392">And so sometimes that's enough. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=393">But not always. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=395">Sometimes you really need to get start digging in a little deeper. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=400">So one of the one of the very handy things about many editors is you can actually go </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=406">from your reference to a particular method in this case to the actual method itself. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=414">So the couple of command clicks in my case, here is the actual code behind that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=419">And the interesting thing to me that is that not is this some abstract representation of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=426">the source code as it exists somewhere. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=429">This is the actual code that is in my virtual environment that is being run whenever I call </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=433">this method. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=435">Which means, of course, that I could just change the code. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=439">You know, I could literally go into this file and say I would like it to work this way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=444">I'm going to edit this file with my editor and then my code will work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=449">This is sort of this is not monkey patching, but this is sort of the, you know, the mad </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=454">man version one of it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=458">This code doesn't work the way I want it to. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=459">I'm just going to change the code. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=461">Of course, maybe this is very obvious to you. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=466">It was not obvious until I tried it once. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=468">Oh, that's not a good idea, because number one, I now have no documentation about what </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=476">I changed and I'm probably going to forget what I did and never going to be able to find </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=479">it again. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=480">And two, the next time I update that package, my beautiful function code is gone. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=485">So not a good plan, but a pretty cool thing that you can do. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=489">And at least digging around and actually looking through the actual source code is a pretty </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=493">handy thing to do. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=494">But if you want to do the slightly saner thing, which is, okay, I have this code, I want it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=500">to behave differently, here's an example of what you can do. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=503">So if I'm building a Streamlet app, it has this markdown function that I think is nice, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=509">but it really could be a little more exciting. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=511">It really could be, you know, I just want to have a little more emphasis, a little more </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=515">oomph, whatever I'm writing, adding some markdown to my app. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=520">So I've taken I've imported my original code, and I've written this new function, which </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=526">takes the same arguments as the old one, and manipulates the Streamlet I've just said a </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=532">little bit and some other boring stuff that I don't care too much about and I just copied </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=536">from the source code of the old one. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=539">The main thing is this line here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=542">And now I can actually replace the old function with my new one by just declaring it to be. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=549">This is now going to be this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=552">And like magic, it just changes, and everything is fine. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=558">And now I can use it, and it works the way it should work, which is every time I write </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=562">something, it yells it out in title in H1 with lots of exclamations. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=570">So this is obviously an incredibly useful example, but you can even do more things with </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=576">monkey patching, and I'll give you another example later. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=584">Another wonderful thing that is more open than it seems at first glance is pretty much </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=592">any website that you use. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=594">So if you're not yet familiar with developer tools, find out how to open developer tools </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=600">in your favorite browser and just start poking around. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=606">And it turns out that there's all kinds of information that you get just from opening </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=610">that up and reloading the page and seeing what happens. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=613">You can look in details about all the different elements on the page and what makes those </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=617">happen. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=618">You can see the underlying source code, what's the JavaScript, what's the CSS behind the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=622">scenes. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=623">You can see what the network traffic is happening. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=625">All kinds of exciting things that are exposed to you, even just as a casual user of the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=631">website. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=632">So that's pretty neat. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=636">But even more fun is it's not just websites anymore. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=641">Your favorite editor may in fact be a website in disguise. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=644">So here is VS Code, and you see that's the same code I was previously editing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=650">On the right I have developer tools open, which you could just open up in VS Code, because </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=657">it's all electron apps these days. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=659">So I can actually see here the network requests that are being made to populate things, to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=666">load plugins, and various things like that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=671">And while we're at it, it's not just editors. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=674">Your instant messaging program may well also be a website under the covers. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=681">So in this case, you don't get it for free. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=684">You have to pass an extra environment variable. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=687">Once you've passed that environment variable, once you've set that environment variable, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=691">now we can explore Slack as a website, which is of course exactly what it is. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=696">It's just a JavaScript app. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=697">HTML, CSS, JavaScript. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=700">Just like I guess everything is these days. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=703">So here is the general channel from a couple weeks ago. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=708">And here are the network calls that are being made. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=711">And there's quite a lot of them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=714">So all right, so what you actually do with that as the most obvious thing that you can </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=722">do, which my students were very thrilled whenever I showed them that they could do this, was </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=726">oh, I can change any website to look any way that I want. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=730">They thought it was really cool that they could go to the school website that showed </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=733">their grades and show it to their parents after they had handily edited it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=738">So of course you can do that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=739">You can play around. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=740">It's very helpful for tweaking designs and things like that if you're actually building </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=745">a website. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=747">But more interesting to me and more practical for a lot of my work is the network tab. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=753">So this is a particular request from the normcomp Slack. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=759">This is one particular request. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=761">I hope I chopped off enough of the token so that you can't impersonate me. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=766">But oh, well. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=768">So this is a request to get and I particularly like the everyone and not bots and not apps. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=776">So apparently this is to populate the list of who is in this channel. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=781">And I think this is the general channel. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=785">And I now not only see that this request was made and have the ability to see, okay, here's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=791">the parameters that were passed. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=793">But developer tools gives me this very wonderful thing, which is I can copy it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=797">I can copy it not just like copy the URL, but copy all of the details behind it so that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=803">I could replay that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=805">And in my terminal I can run a curl command to rerun that exact query with all of the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=813">cookies and everything set so that I can it just works until my token expires and things </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=818">like that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=819">But for now I could rerun that and get that data out as a curl command. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=826">Maybe you love Unix kind of tools like curl. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=829">I personally don't have a I love that they work and they're simple, but I often prefer </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=836">to bring them into something I'm a little more familiar with. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=839">So there's probably several tools like this, but one that I like is curl converter, which </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=843">allows you to take a curl command and convert it into the language of your choice. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=848">So here's that specific request turned into Python with a little bit of details stripped </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=853">out. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=854">And then this is now a functioning Python script that will return a response object </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=858">that I can then get as JSON or whatever I want. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=862">And it just works. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=864">And now I can do programmatic things like maybe I really do want to see bots. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=868">Maybe whatever. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=869">Maybe I want to see what apps are loaded in this channel. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=871">Or I just want to make a cool contact list of all the cool people who are in the general </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=878">channel in norm conf. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=882">So turns out this is oftentimes a good way to work with a website or an app disguised </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=889">as a website. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=890">I had a friend in another Slack group ask about, hey, is there anybody know any good </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=898">packages for scraping the Jenkins API? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=902">And I responded very cheekily with requests. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=905">And it turned out it actually was a pretty good option. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=909">So oftentimes just a simple ability to make arbitrary requests and take an actual network </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=918">request that are being made and turn them into code turns out to be really useful. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=925">So I want to talk about two real world ways that I've used this kind of digging into internals. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=933">One particular one happened a few months ago. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=937">And we had this situation where we had all this data that was being collected in a data </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=940">dog and it was really useful for alerting engineers when something happened. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=944">But we wanted to store it in a more long term place. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=946">We wanted to put it in our warehouse so we could have it for queries later and see how </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=951">things were happening over time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=954">And there wasn't a real straightforward obvious way that I could find to do this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=957">So a colleague and I worked on a way to do this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=962">And one of the first things that he actually found was data dog has this wonderful UI and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=970">their website for building these queries and building up these monitors. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=974">And then they even give you a export as cURL, which is just a really wonderful thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=981">It really encourages this kind of use this other places reusability. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=986">It's a very nice feature. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=988">And so that immediately gave us what we wanted. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=992">Almost. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=993">We really wanted it to be a little more programmatic than just the raw cURL request. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=998">It turns out they also have a nice Python API to wrap around those cURL commands. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1005">And you can basically take the query part of it and slap it into this Python library </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1012">and you get out something that yeah. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1014">And you have type hints and all that niceness because the library knows when it returns. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1020">But used it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1023">Sometimes it worked. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1024">But I found a case where it didn't work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1027">It was complaining that it was expecting a string and it was throwing a validation error </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1032">because it was receiving a Boolean. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1035">I was very sure as far as I could tell things were set up right on the data dog side. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1040">It really was supposed to be a Boolean. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1042">I think I was using the wrapper right. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1044">Very possibly I wasn't. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1045">But as far as I could tell, I was. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1047">And I need to get around this error. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1049">So what did I do? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1051">Monkey patch it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1053">And it turned out to be as simple as here's the old version of the method. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1061">Here's my new version of the method which has the same arguments and it returns the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1065">old version except in this case. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1067">And it just skips the validation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1070">Is that a great idea? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1071">It worked and it solved my problem. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1073">And I knew for sure I was smarter than this validator. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1076">This really was supposed to be Boolean. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1078">So it worked out okay. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1080">And then I just slapped that in and ta da! </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1083">Everything worked great. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1084">Other than that, no issues. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1088">One other issue that's very one other example of this is very near and dear to my heart. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1092">So I'm on the part of the Streamlet data team. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1096">I don't work on the Streamlet core, but we use Streamlet a lot. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1098">So we build a lot of apps for seeing how things are how are things going in the ecosystem </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1104">or people using it or people using the new features. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1108">And we tend to, you know, get the bleeding edge of the latest and greatest features and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1111">get real excited. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1113">And we were so excited when the multi page app, the native multi page app feature, you </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1116">get this nice sidebar with all the different pages. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1119">It changes your URL. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1120">We could throw out the old radio button based one. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1125">But as soon as I started using it, I realized, oh, you get this boring file icon. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1132">But you can put emojis in, just like we did in our radio button version. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1136">But you have to put emojis in the file name. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1139">And trust me, it's like my stomach putting emojis in my file name. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1145">It hurt my soul too deeply to allow this to be the way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1150">And so I had to find a hat. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1152">So looked around in the Python source code and found this method that's being called </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1159">to generate that sidebar, which is called get pages. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1163">And lo and behold, it returns this dictionary that is a global variable that is cached. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f4yYwsqQD8&t=1169">Which means that if I make a new method that takes that calls that get pages method, empties </a><a
