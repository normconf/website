        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=0">Hello, everybody. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1">Hello, NormConf. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=2">My name is Peter. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=3">And as was just mentioned, it's all about cost. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=6">This talk is about how to think about machine learning products specifically from an engineering </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=9">perspective to try and save money. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=12">So first off, who am I and why am I talking to you today? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=15">Well, my name is Peter Sobot. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=16">I'm a staff machine learning engineer. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=18">By day, I work on audio-based machine learning for all sorts of interesting purposes, trying </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=23">to tell people how happy songs are or how energetic songs are and doing all sorts of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=28">cool stuff with data and music like that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=31">If you've been online on Twitter and you do audio-based machine learning or anything to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=35">do with audio, you may have seen one of the packages that I work on called Pedalboard </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=38">for doing nice stuff with audio in Python. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=41">But today, I'm not talking about any of those specifics or what I actually do day to day. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=46">Today I'm focusing on how I tend to apply engineering principles to the world of data </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=50">science and machine learning so that we can deploy things to millions and millions of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=54">users without breaking the bank. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=56">And I really want to focus on this word engineer first, because this is really where I'm coming </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=61">from. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=62">I don't consider myself a data person or a data science person or anything like that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=67">I've been working in machine learning for years now and I have a good grounding in it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=70">But what I really come from, my background is really more in what I would call traditional </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=75">engineering. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=76">I was educated as an engineer, as a software engineer technically, but still at a school </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=81">that really focused on things like engineering for bridges and engineering for roads and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=86">engineering for all these big structures that humans have been building for hundreds of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=90">years. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=91">Now, how does this relate to data science and machine learning? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=93">Well, engineering is really all about building systems that are scalable, reliable, and come </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=98">within cost and budget and things like that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=101">And the reason it's treated as a separate discipline or it's something that people give </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=104">a name to is really that these systems fail over time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=109">And over the past couple of hundreds of years, many of these engineering systems have failed </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=112">and we've learned terrible lessons about that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=115">The bridge you see on the screen here is not actually just any bridge, but it's a bridge </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=118">called the Quebec Bridge in the Canadian province of Quebec. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=121">And it fell down twice during construction. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=124">And we have this bridge to thank, or specifically the negligence of its engineers for what we </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=127">call modern engineering today. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=129">So if you've ever heard of some engineers having licenses or being professionally regulated </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=133">or being members of professional organizations, specifically outside of tech, this is very </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=137">common. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=138">And that's because this bridge failure and the corners that were cut during this bridge's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=142">construction really started the process of having engineering being more regulated and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=147">being treated like a very serious profession in a way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=150">Fun side note, if you're a Canadian engineer like I am, when you graduate, you get a ring </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=154">from this bridge or supposedly made from the iron of this bridge to remind you every time </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=158">that you sign your name to a document, the bridge fell down, make sure you're doing this </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=162">right. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=164">But I digress. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=165">This bridge really fell down because corners were cut and constraints for the problem were </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=168">not well observed. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=170">Engineering fundamentally is about building the best thing that you can, given the constraints </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=174">of the problem itself. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=176">And many of these constraints are kind of obvious. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=177">So you've got things like safety and reliability. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=180">You want anything you build to be safe and reliable. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=183">And others apply to really any project, not just engineering projects like time and cost, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=187">right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=188">We don't have infinite time to build a system. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=189">We don't have infinite budget to build a system either. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=193">So this brings me to the way that I think about engineering in general, and this applies </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=196">to machine learning just as much as it applies to bridges. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=200">One can build a bridge that stands, but it takes an engineer to build a bridge that barely </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=204">stands. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=205">And this seems kind of flippant, and it is. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=207">But what this really means is it takes an engineer to build a bridge that is cheap enough </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=211">so that it barely stands, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=212">It takes an engineer to build a bridge that meets the design criteria in such a way that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=217">it fulfills all of the things that we need to fulfill, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=219">It's not over budget. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=220">It doesn't take forever to build. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=222">And we can do it without bankrupting the town that asked for the bridge or the company that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=226">asked for the software to be built. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=228">In this case, think about the fact that the Romans built bridges thousands of years ago </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=231">that still stand today, but they were extremely expensive even by their standards. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=235">And today we wouldn't do the same thing because we have costs to think about. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=239">So to finish off this little tangent about engineering and kind of where I'm coming from </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=242">here, I want to compare two different fields of engineering, and that is civil engineering, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=246">where we're building bridges and software engineering, where we're building, well, software. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=250">And that includes data systems and ML systems and whatnot. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=253">In both of these fields, one of the most important choices you get to make when you're starting </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=257">a project is what material to use or what tools with frameworks and so on to use. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=261">In civil engineering, this might be what you literally build your bridge out of. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=264">In software engineering, this might be what framework do you choose or what language do </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=268">you use or things like that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=270">And these all have different trade-offs and different costs and different amounts of performance </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=273">you can get from them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=274">In civil engineering, you might build your bridge out of wood, and that's great. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=277">It's plentiful. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=278">It literally grows on trees. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=280">Everybody knows where to get wood from. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=282">And in software engineering, the analog might be something like JavaScript. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=285">It runs everywhere. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=286">Seemingly, everybody can write JavaScript. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=288">It's very, very common. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=289">It's cheap to build, but it might not be as powerful as you want it to be, or it might </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=292">not be able to do certain things that you want your software to do. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=296">In civil engineering, you might use iron if you want to build a bridge that's a bit more </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=299">sturdy than your wooden bridge there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=301">And in software engineering, maybe you would choose Python. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=303">Again, a little bit more expensive, maybe sometimes harder to build, but gives us more </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=308">performance. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=309">Continuing down the list, you might use steel to build your bridge if you really want something </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=313">that is very performant or very sturdy. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=316">And in software engineering, maybe you want to rewrite your code in C++ if you want to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=319">make it even faster to run or to run in certain scenarios where Python is just too heavy or </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=324">too slow, but it takes a lot longer to write your code, so it's more expensive. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=328">And then continuing to the very bottom of the cost here, I guess the most expensive </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=332">options. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=333">In civil engineering, there are new materials that people are using all the time, one of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=336">which, for example, might be carbon fiber. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=338">You wouldn't build a whole bridge out of carbon fiber. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=340">That's quite expensive to do. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=342">But for certain applications, carbon fiber really gives you a lot of strength and it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=346">can do things that other materials cannot do. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=348">And the equivalent here in software engineering, in my opinion, is machine learning. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=352">It's like the carbon fiber of bridges. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=354">You don't want to build an entire bridge out of carbon fiber. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=356">You wouldn't want to build your entire project out of machine learning, but it's got some </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=360">very, very nice properties. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=361">And if you're willing to pay for it, it can do some things that other materials cannot. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=366">So if machine learning is the new expensive tool that everybody wants to use, then how </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=370">can we use less of it in order to save money? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=372">How can we still get the benefits of machine learning, but not have to put it everywhere </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=376">in our product and use it as minimally as possible to still make it economical to deploy? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=382">That's basically the entire point of my talk today. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=383">So let's dive into this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=385">Congratulations. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=387">You and I, everybody on this call, we all now work at a new company. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=391">And this company is called VideoChat Inc. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=394">It's actually the video conferencing platform that we're using right now to host this conference. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=397">And it's how you might talk to your coworkers every day. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=400">This fictional company is the world's most popular video conference platform. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=403">And we are engineers or data scientists or machine learning people on one of its engineering </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=408">teams. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=409">And we've been tasked with building interesting new features for VideoChat. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=412">One such new feature just came on our desks right now. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=415">And it showed up as this RFC. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=418">The business people and product people at VideoChat Inc. want us to build a coffee brand </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=422">detector. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=423">Now what that means is they want us to build a system such that on each video call, VideoChat </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=428">Inc. can automatically detect the brand of coffee that shows up in video calls and then </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=433">automatically put a button on the screen so users can reorder their coffee and stay caffeinated </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=438">without even leaving their seats. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=440">Sounds like a pretty lofty idea, but it also sounds like something that isn't impossible </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=444">to build. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=445">So we might as well get started here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=446">Now, if you're a machine learning practitioner, as soon as you see something like this, you </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=450">might start to think of ways to implement it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=452">You might jump in and say, well, I could use an object detection model. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=455">I could use PyTorch Vision or ResNets or any things that you've seen online or in the community. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=460">And that's great. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=461">But coming from an engineering perspective, that's like someone telling me to build a </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=465">bridge and me saying, well, I'd love to build that bridge out of wood, even though I don't </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=468">know which river it's going to cross or how many people need to be on top of it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=474">We don't need to use our tools anywhere near this point in the process. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=478">We should instead figure out what this project needs and what the requirements are. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=482">So let's do that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=483">Let's say that we've worked with the product team and the business team to figure out the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=486">actual needs here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=487">And we've come up with a list that we can use to start building. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=490">This does sound kind of waterfally and less agile, maybe. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=494">But for a big project like this, we need at least some guidelines to work within. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=498">So we've come up with these requirements and I've split these requirements into two different </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=502">lists. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=503">Now they're in two different lists because this is a technique that comes from more traditional </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=506">engineering. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=507">We've got one list called functional requirements and another called non-functional requirements. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=511">Now the functional requirements are things that we need to make the system work in the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=514">first place. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=515">Right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=516">So this functional requirements list is how we judge if the system is done, if it's been </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=521">built yet. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=522">And then non-functional requirements are ways that we can evaluate how well we did or the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=526">quality of the final system. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=528">So regardless of if it works, was it cheap enough for us to build or is it fast enough </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=533">if it's a software system, stuff like that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=535">So our fictional system here is going to have a couple of functional requirements. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=539">We need to be able to detect the top 10 most popular coffee brands that show up in people's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=542">video calls. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=543">We also want to be able to detect the brand of up to 1000 users of the system per day. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=548">So that's our load. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=549">That's kind of our scope here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=551">And then also our system must have a precision of at least 99% and a recall of at least 90%. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=555">So these numbers are kind of just picked out of thin air, but we can try to build a system </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=559">that does have these numbers. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=561">And then for non-functional requirements, well, we want the system to cost less than </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=564">$100 per day, which is quite tight time bound or sorry, quite a tight cost bound. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=569">But we definitely want to make sure that we respect that because that's going to determine </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=572">if we can deploy this or not. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=575">And the system must provide data by the end of each day. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=577">So it doesn't really matter exactly how quickly or how slowly it works as long as we give </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=581">the results to the business about the end of each day. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=585">So with those requirements in mind, let's do some engineering. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=589">So big disclaimer first, the following calculations are incredibly oversimplified to make a friendly </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=594">and digestible point in a 20 minute talk. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=596">Do not depend on these numbers. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=598">You might find bugs in them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=599">You might find miscalculations. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=601">But given that, please continue to suspend your disbelief for the rest of my talk here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=606">So following from Joel's talk that you just heard from, let's start with the simplest </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=610">thing that might possibly work first. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=612">Let's have a tip number one at the bottom of the screen here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=614">Let's just run machine learning on every single frame of the video we get in real time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=619">So we get frames coming in from our customers, just like what you're seeing right now. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=623">Some of these frames have coffee cups in them and others don't. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=626">And let's say we pick an object detection model off of GitHub. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=629">Someone's already pre-trained one for us and it has the required accuracy that we're looking </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=633">for. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=634">Let's just run that on every single frame of video in real time and take the outputs </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=637">and put them into some sort of aggregation tool for later. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=641">Now I'm going to do a bunch of back of the envelope calculations here on the left hand </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=644">side and I'm going to fill up with a bunch of numbers, but don't be too scared. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=649">I'll talk through every single number as we go through. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=651">We know our daily compute budget is $100. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=653">So that's what we want to be underneath here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=656">And we know we get in 30 frames per second of video from each user. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=660">We also know that this PyTorch model we have here, well, let's say we've measured it and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=663">we found that there's a certain number of floating point operations we need to do in </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=667">that model to process each frame. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=670">From our measurements, that turns out to be about 40 billion floating point operations, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=673">which sounds like a lot and kind of is a lot, but multiplying these numbers out tells us </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=677">that we need about 1.2 teraflops per second of computing power to process these videos </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=683">in real time and give us results. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=685">That's actually kind of doable on modern GPUs. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=687">This is not too out of the ordinary. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=690">Then we also know we have a maximum daily load of 1 million users. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=693">We know that we have about four hours of daily usage per user. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=697">People are on this app all the time because they talk to their coworkers and they spend </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=701">half their days in meetings, or at least I do. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=704">And then that multiplied out means that our daily hours of video is 4 million hours per </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=708">day we need to process. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=709">So that's quite a bit of video. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=712">Then multiplying that by the number of teraflops per stream, well, that means we need 17.3 </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=717">zeta flops or zeta flops. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=719">I don't know how to pronounce this number, but it's a lot. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=722">And we're going to have to use that to estimate our cost here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=726">So let's say we have GPUs available in our cloud of choice and we're using the cloud </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=730">here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=731">The number of GPUs available per GPU turns out to be 8.7 teraflops and dividing those </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=735">two numbers, we need 551,724 GPU hours per day to make this work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=742">That sounds like a lot, but let's suspend our disbelief here and say that we can get </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=746">that amount of GPU capacity and we just have to pay for it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=750">Looking at our price sheet here, let's say our cost per GPU hour is 45 cents. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=755">And that means our total daily compute cost is only $248,275 per day. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=761">That's a quarter million dollars per day. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=763">I don't know about you, but that's not viable for any environment I've ever worked in. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=767">And if I presented that to the folks who asked for a product like this, they would probably </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=772">laugh me out of the room and find a engineer who can build a system that actually works. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=777">So let's see which numbers that we can change here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=781">What can we look at to make this system cheaper without sacrificing our functional requirements </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=785">like our accuracy and our load and such like that? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=788">Well, to start with, we have the number of frames per second that we're processing here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=792">We're processing every single frame of video right now. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=794">So attempt number two might be something as simple as just run the ML on fewer frames, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=799">right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=800">Just run ML on some of the frames. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=801">Don't even change the model just yet. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=803">Let's just sub-sample the stream. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=805">And I know this is a big if. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=806">We don't actually know if this is going to work, but I'm going to guess that if you're </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=809">drinking coffee, you can't raise the coffee cup to your mouth and take a drink in less </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=813">than 1 30th of a second. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=815">It's going to take longer than that for you to actually take a sip of coffee. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=818">So this assumption might have to be tested offline, but let's say let's run with it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=823">This reduces our frames per second to one frame per second. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=826">And then our per stream compute is now 30 times lower. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=828">So only 40 gigaflops across our entire user base. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=831">The number of daily flops required is a much more pronounceable 576 exaflops. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=837">And that means the number of GPU hours required is actually within the realm of possibility. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=840">We only need 18,400 GPU hours, which could be done with a large GPU cluster maybe. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=846">And at the cost of 45 cents per GPU hour, this only costs $8,280 now. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=851">So we're down from a quarter million dollars a day to just less than 10,000, which is still </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=854">quite a lot and almost 10 times our budget, but it's gone from being completely unenviable </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=860">to maybe we could kind of do this, but let's keep going. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=864">What else can we do to make this cheaper and find a solution that optimizes for all of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=868">our constraints? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=869">Well, let's take a look at the number of floating point operations per frame that we're running </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=872">here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=873">We've got this PyTorch model that we pulled off the internet. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=875">It works, but can we make it faster? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=877">Can we make it smaller? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=878">And this is where I'm going to, I know this is Norm Kant, we're not talking about papers, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=882">but I'm going to show a paper on the screen. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=885">I'm so sorry. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=886">One second here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=887">It'll be only up for a second. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=888">Don't worry. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=889">So this is a paper from Google from 2017. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=892">It's called MobileNet and it presents a class of efficient models called MobileNets for </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=896">mobile and embedded vision applications. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=898">Now, what these researchers have found is they can change the model architecture they </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=902">use for object detection and spend one 10th of the computing power for only a small drop </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=907">in accuracy of a couple percentage points. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=910">If we use this architecture or any similar cheap architecture to run our model, we can </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=915">potentially get huge gains in cost or huge savings in cost without significantly affecting </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=920">our performance. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=921">So let's do that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=922">Let's say that we've retrained our model. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=923">We still have video coming in here, but let's retrain this model with a more efficient architecture. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=928">Now let's deploy this with something a little more optimized for cost. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=932">Let's maybe use TensorFlow Lite and let's deploy this as a MobileNet on our back ends </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=937">here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=938">And each frame of video is still giving us the same outputs, but we only need to spend </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=941">4 billion flops per frame instead of 40 billion. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=945">That reduces our per stream compute to 4 gigaflops per second, which is much more manageable. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=949">Again, now by a factor of 10, our daily flops required is 57.6 exaflops, much better. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=955">GPU hours is now only 1,840, and that means our total daily cost is $828, which again, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=961">still a lot, still almost 10 times our cost budget, but we're getting really close here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=966">Our viability is, you know, within a stone's throw from what we've got now. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=969">But what can we do next? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=971">What's the next thing we can turn to? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=973">Well, I see one number in this list that's a little bit suspect, and that's the number </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=977">of floating point operations that a single GPU can do. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=981">This number seems low to me because GPUs get more powerful every single year. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=986">And if we were to simply upgrade to more expensive, more modern GPUs, we might be able to get </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=990">much more performance per dollar here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=992">So let's try that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=993">For attempt number four, let's use more cost effective GPUs. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=997">And if I pick the most advanced GPU on the shelf right now, I can get 312 teraflops per </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1002">second instead of 8.7 per GPU. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1005">And that means we only need 52 hours of GPU time per day instead of those thousands we </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1009">had before. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1011">Even though these GPUs are more expensive at $2.93 each rather than what they were before. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1017">And this reduces our cost even more. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1019">This means our total daily compute cost for all this GPU time is only $152. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1024">Which is great. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1025">This is amazing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1026">This is only 52% over budget, which for many engineering projects would be a slam dunk, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1030">a huge success. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1032">But we can go even cheaper. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1034">What do we do to get down from $152 to almost $0? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1037">Well, I have a proposal here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1039">What if we take this model we have here and we were to make an even cheaper model, even </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1044">faster model that is way, way, way less accurate. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1047">I know we have accuracy bounds. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1048">We want a certain amount of precision and recall here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1050">What if we retrain this model, use some transfer learning and build our own copy of it? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1054">That is wrong a lot of the time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1057">We can get our per stream compute numbers down here by a huge factor if we just pre-filter </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1060">some of our data and only deploy our more expensive model on frames that were reasonably </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1064">certain already contained coffee cups. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1067">So let's do that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1068">For attempt number five here, let's use a two-stage model architecture. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1072">So let's take our original model. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1073">Let's retrain it so that it gives us a huge amount of recall. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1076">It catches almost all the coffee cups that do show up in frame, but it's not very precise. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1081">Sometimes it'll think that a cell phone is a coffee cup rather than an actual coffee </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1084">cup or a cell phone. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1086">But this model here is much cheaper. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1088">It only requires 100 megaflops per second, and it could even run on CPUs, which is great. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1094">So we're almost done here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1096">Let's take this and drop this into temporary storage. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1098">So the outputs of this model go in there, and then we run a batch pipeline and then </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1102">drop the results into mobile net. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1105">And then there we have our full precision output. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1109">If I race through all these numbers here, because I know I'm almost out of time, this </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1112">reduces our cost all the way down. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1115">We only need to run our heavy model on 0.0001 frames per second. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1119">Our offline computing power is in the kiloflops instead of the teraflops. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1123">And multiplying all the numbers out, we get to $0.01 or one cent. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1128">Of course, I'm ignoring a bunch of overhead here, but we're pretty much good to go. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1132">And that's all I've got. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1133">We talked about five things, how to do the simplest approach first, how to process less </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1137">data, how to make our model smaller, how to use more efficient hardware, and then finally, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1142">how to split up our model and use cheap ML to pre-filter our data before applying the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1146">heavy ML. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1148">And thanks so much for listening. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1149">I'll stick around for questions, but that's my talk. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGTlsYjijI&t=1150">Thanks, NarmConf. </a>
