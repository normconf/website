        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=0">So, I'm Joel, and I'm going to talk about what is the simplest possible thing that might </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=5">work and why didn't you try that first. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=8">So first I tried to ask chat GPT to write my talk, but it gave me one of its mealy-mouthed, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=14">you know, it's complicated answers. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=16">If you're playing norm conf bingo, I hope you have chat GPT on your card a lot, because </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=20">that's probably the only one that you're going to get, but you'll get it a lot of times. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=24">So anyway, like I said, I'm Joel. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=25">I wrote a book called Data Science from Scratch, which was mentioned. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=28">I also more recently wrote a book called 10 Essays on Fizz Buzz, which is interesting. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=31">You should check it out. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=34">I'm known sometimes for my live coding videos, and more infamously, I'm the guy who does </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=38">not like Jupyter notebooks. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=40">And so if you don't like Jupyter notebooks, you can watch my talk and agree. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=44">Or if you do like them, you can watch my talk and not agree. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=47">And I have a podcast, Abracadabra Learning, which I didn't plug because we never make </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=50">new episodes anymore, but maybe we will. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=53">So most of you have never worked with me, but if you had, you would know that my favorite </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=57">people to ask questions or my favorite question to ask people about the problems is, what </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=61">is the simplest thing that might possibly work? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=64">And the reason I started asking that is because people like to make things overly complicated. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=69">For example, not too long ago, I was talking with someone who wanted to do a machine learning </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=72">project involving book reviews. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=75">And so they needed book reviews. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=78">And so they started asking questions about like, what's the best way to build a Goodreads </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=81">scraper? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=82">And if you look, building a Goodreads scraper is a non-trivial endeavor. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=89">And so I looked in the mirror and asked myself, what is the simplest thing that might possibly </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=92">work? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=93">And that was, hey, maybe someone else has already scraped this dataset and shared it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=96">And sure enough, it turns out that they have. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=99">And so that was potentially a better solution, a simpler solution. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=103">And chatGPT knows this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=104">If you asked it how to get the book reviews data, it will suggest downloading it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=107">I'm very bullish on chatGPT. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=109">I would be even more bullish if it weren't broken. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=112">Half the time I asked it to try to slide, but big things are coming. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=116">And so over the course of my career, I've spent a lot of time teaching diverse teams </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=120">of junior data scientists to do good data science. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=123">I've done this so much that if you ask Dally to draw a picture of someone doing this, it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=127">draws a picture that looks almost exactly like me. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=129">And so my style is to go off and let people try things. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=132">And then they try things and they come back and they tell me about them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=135">And so then I have to ask, what's the simplest thing that might possibly work? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=137">And why didn't you try that first? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=139">And so I kept asking that a lot. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=142">But the further I go, I find that simplicity is not... </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=146">Well, one, it's not easy to get an AI to draw it, but also it's not easy to define. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=151">And so, you know, here's this quote about simplicity requires hard work to achieve and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=155">complexity sells better. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=157">So maybe simplicity is sort of the opposite of complexity. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=160">Okay, well, then what's complexity? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=163">Well, you know, if you do machine learning, you've probably seen this bias-variance trade-off </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=167">graph where as your model gets more complex, the bias goes down and the variance goes up. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=172">And here, complexity means something like, you know, number of parameters or model capacity. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=177">Is that a good way to think about it? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=178">That's probably not how I want to think about it, but we'll see. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=181">And you can find examples of, you know, here are some models that are simpler in the model </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=186">capacity sense that do better than models that are more complex. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=189">And, you know, people will write about these. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=191">That's not where I kind of want to go. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=194">Rather, I would like to really seek what is simplicity and then you can distrust what </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=200">I say. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=202">So a big part of why I ended up thinking about this problem is that for the last five plus </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=207">years I've been doing a lot of natural language processing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=209">And so I'm always talking to people about their natural language processing problems. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=213">And so I talked to a lot of people about text classification. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=216">It's come up a couple of times today already. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=218">And so if you're not an LP person, text classification is exactly what it sounds like. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=222">Trying to decide whether email is spam or not. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=225">Trying to decide whether a piece of text has positive sentiment or negative sentiment or </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=228">neither. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=229">Trying to decide whether a blog comment is toxic or whether a talk is worth attending </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=233">based on its title or its abstract or its presenter. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=236">Or whether a machine learning model is simple based on its description. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=238">So there's a lot of ways you could proceed. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=240">You know, one easy approach might be logistic regression. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=244">Take each email, convert it to a feature vector somehow using like bag of words or one-hot </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=248">decoding or averaging word vectors and then you learn some weights, one per feature. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=253">So that's basically like one parameter for each word in your vocabulary. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=257">So you know, that's reasonably simple. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=261">Another very classic approach is what's called naive Bayes classification. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=264">I don't want to go through the math, but you chop your email into words. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=267">You do some computation about how likely you are to see a given word in the spam email </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=271">or not. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=272">And then you apply this PIPA-BEBE theorem and then you know, you get it out. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=277">This is kind of the classical approach to spam detection. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=279">There's a chapter on my book. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=281">You could implement it yourself in an afternoon. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=284">And it again has like N parameters where that's the number of words. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=291">About five years ago, the state of the art would have been, you know, this less dim, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=294">tat-dim model where you take your email, convert it to a sequence of embeddings, run them through </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=299">this recurrent neural network, get a final state, classify that hidden state. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=302">You know, this is now suddenly thousands and thousands of parameters for all these matrices </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=306">that you're multiplying by. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=309">And you know, more recently you do a BERT model, which I'm using in shorthand for any </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=312">kind of transformer model, where you take the email, convert it to a bunch of different </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=315">embeddings, feed it to the transformer, get some pre-trained embedding as input to the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=321">classifier, fine tune it, and now you're talking like hundreds of millions of parameters. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=326">And so, you know, if I could see you and listen to you, I would ask you a question and I would </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=331">say, which of these is the simplest approach to test classification? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=337">Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, LSTM, or BERT? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=340">And so there's no audience feedback, but I'm just going to assume that you're all voting </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=344">for choice number one. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=348">So I don't know, I don't think there's a right answer. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=352">People can differ. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=353">But now here's a different question. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=354">Let's say you had a friend who was a junior data scientist and they needed to do some </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=358">kind of test classification and they needed to get good results and their job depended </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=361">on them getting good results. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=364">What would you recommend? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=366">And there I know what the answer is. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=368">I would recommend that they use BERT. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=370">And I know that's the answer because I keep meeting people who are doing test classification </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=373">using Naive Bayes or, you know, logistic regression or XGBoost on TFIDF vectors or other things </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=379">you don't even want to know about. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=381">And I'm like, why did you not just use BERT? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=384">And so it's not just that I tell them to use BERT, it's like, why are you wasting your </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=389">time doing the others? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=390">But then there's this tension, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=392">Like on one hand, you have this angel on my shoulder saying, try the simplest thing first. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=397">And then you also have this devil that's like, why did you just not use BERT? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=401">And so I felt like there was this contradiction there, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=407">And so what do we do when we feel like we have a contradiction? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=410">You know, you turn to Anne Rand and she says, contradictions do not exist. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=414">When you think you have one, check your premises and one of them is wrong. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=418">So which of my premises is wrong? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=423">Well, let's take a step back. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=426">When we did that LSTM model, I said that it had thousands of parameters from these matrices </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=431">that were multiplying things by and so on and so forth. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=433">But the reason that that model only has thousands of parameters is that it's kind of free riding </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=438">off of whatever text embedding model you're using, GloVe vectors or Word2Vec. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=442">If you go and set out to download the GloVe vectors themselves, that's going to be hundreds </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=446">of megabytes of data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=448">So maybe those should count for part of the complexity of the model that, you know, in </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=453">this model, you have millions of parameters worth of data that choose which word goes </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=458">to which vector. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=459">But most of those parameters are already fixed by the time you show up. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=464">Someone had to learn those vectors once, but then you can use them over and over again </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=467">for different problems, just changing some parameters here and there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=472">So they're a black box that's not really part of our model. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=475">Do they count as complexity? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=477">They're pretty complex. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=478">Or do they count as simplicity because they move the complexity kind of out of our modeling </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=483">and into the pre-processing, if you will. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=487">And so, you know, if we go back to BERT, you could also think of the BERT embeddings as </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=496">a black box. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=498">So I think a BERT is something where I give it, you know, a sentence and it spits out </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=504">an embedding. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=505">Okay. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=506">And now I take that embedding, use it as input to some simple classifier, logistic regression </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=510">or whatever. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=511">And now I fine tune this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=513">And that part of the model itself, that's thousands of parameters, not millions of parameters, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=518">right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=519">And then like, you know, I'm cheating a little bit because when you fine tune, you are like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=522">updating those BERT weights somewhat, so they're not quite a black box or like a gray box. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=527">But there's actually, outside of BERT computing those embeddings for you, there's not a lot </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=531">going on. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=532">In fact, there's less going on there than in the, you know, fancy LSTM model. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=538">And what's more, there's also some hidden complexity in the simple models like Naive </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=542">Bayes. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=543">So, you know, imagine you're doing this Naive Bayes where I want to chop my email into words. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=547">Well, maybe I also want to consider phrases. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=549">So now I need to, you know, look at n-grams rather than words. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=551">And maybe I want to filter out stop words. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=553">And maybe I would like to do some kind of stemming so that classifier and classification </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=557">show up as basically the same word. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=559">Maybe I want to split out contractions. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=561">Maybe I want to do any number of things. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=564">And so, you know, once you get into the mechanics of I want to do a simple Naive Bayes model </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=568">on this, you have to make a lot of choices and you have a lot of degrees of freedom. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=575">And suddenly, if you include those degrees of freedom in your model, it's less simple </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=580">with, you know, one of these transformer models. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=582">You just kind of shove the text in and it does with it what it does with it to kind </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=586">of go back to what we were talking about earlier about find methods that can cope with your </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=591">dirty data and just ignore it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=595">So this is a lot of clutter. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=601">So where do we find the simplicity? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=606">And you know, I mentioned woodworking at the start. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=608">So now I'm actually going to talk about woodworking and hopefully it will be relevant and make </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=615">sense. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=616">So as I mentioned, you know, in the pre-talk banter, woodworking is sort of a new hobby </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=622">of mine. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=623">I only started doing it in earnest a month or two ago. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=627">But what I've been doing all year is watching woodworking videos on YouTube. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=631">In fact, I'm not bragging when I say that I'm pretty much like a savant at watching </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=635">woodworking videos on YouTube. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=637">Like I'm really, you know, I'm a 10X woodworking video watcher, if you will. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=642">As a woodworker, I'm not that good. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=644">I barely know how to use the tools, but good at the watching videos. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=648">So now imagine that you and your friends are like building a dining table, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=654">And so like these people, I think they're people, you have no idea what you're doing, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=659">but you know, you don't want it to have these sort of ugly, simple square legs. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=664">You want your table to be beautiful and have these complex tapered legs with, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=668">nice slopes that intersect each other and that look good. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=672">And so, you know, one thing you can do, obviously what's the simplest thing you can do, and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=676">why do you not do that first is you can go to Amazon and buy tapered legs. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=680">It'll cost you 175 bucks. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=682">But if you just want legs and you just want to buy them, then you can do it that way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=689">It works, it's expensive. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=692">But it is an intricate and involved process. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=697">And there's a lot of ways that it can go wrong. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=699">If you're not like a master craftsman like this guy, like this is a video of someone, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=702">you know, making tapered legs. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=703">He's really good at what he does. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=704">And he's got all these hand tools and he makes this precise cuts and, you know, it turns </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=709">out beautifully. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=711">But then you watch more YouTube videos and you start learning about jigs. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=716">And so a jig is sort of like a tool that you build to take away some of your complexity. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=722">So this here is a tapering jig. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=724">I want to cut a piece of wood at a specific angle to a specific length. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=729">So I build this little frame that I can put my wood in. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=732">It has a stop so that the wood can only go in really one place. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=735">And it has another stop that holds the wood at exactly one angle. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=739">And you put a piece of wood in, you run it through your table saw, and you get the exact, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=743">you know, slope and size that you want. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=745">And it's repeatable and it always works. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=748">And so all you have to do is, you know, however many of these pieces you want. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=752">You shove a piece of wood in it, you run it through the table saw, and you try not to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=755">cut your fingers off and, you know, you're done. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=758">And it's suggested to me that how simple something is, is not just how complex it is in theory, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=765">but also how difficult is it for you to try it? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=769">So you know, if it's 2018 and you wanted to fine tune a BERT model, you were signing up </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=775">for a lot of work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=776">This is one of the examples. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=777">This is a text classification example from PyTorch pre-trained BERT, which was like the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=783">original precursor that became Hugging Face eventually. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=786">And if you wanted to make it work on your data, you were signing up for a minor adventure. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=790">This is like line 532 of the text classification example. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=796">And so, you know, many, many hundreds of lines of code. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=800">In 2022, if you want to fine tune BERT, like this is basically it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=804">You import a couple of things from Transformers and, you know, create a tokenizer, create </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=810">a padding collator, create a model, train it, and train. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=814">And like, I've left out a few lines, but this is like basically it, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=819">These days, you know, in 2018, it was not simple to use BERT. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=822">It was not simple to fine tune a BERT model. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=824">Today it is pretty simple to use a BERT model. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=826">And in fact, I would argue it's simpler to get good results by fine tuning a BERT model </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=831">than it is to get good results with a simpler model. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=835">And if you just want like the pre-trained embeddings out of it, it's even simpler. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=838">It's basically three lines of code. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=839">You import from Sentence Transformers, load a model, and say encode my sentences, and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=842">you're done. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=843">So, there's like nothing to it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=847">So maybe when I talk about simplicity, I mean not just a model that's itself simple, but </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=850">a model by which it's simple to get good results. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=853">So, you know, one other example that's slightly out of the ML data science space is sorting. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=859">Sorting algorithms can be really simple. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=860">You know, sometimes if you interview canonically, they'll ask you to implement, you know, bubble </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=864">sort or merge sort or quick sort or whatever. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=867">You know, back when I was preparing for coding interviews back in the day, I memorized like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=871">every one known to man. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=873">Not that that's really done me any good. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=875">And Python uses an algorithm called TimSort. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=879">You know, my guess is that most of you don't know how TimSort works, because I don't know </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=883">how TimSort works. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=884">It's slightly complicated. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=885">It's not obvious. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=886">It's not a simple algorithm. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=890">And yet it's simple to use, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=892">So if you say, if you ask a chat GPT, what's the simplest sorting algorithm? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=896">It says probably bubble sort. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=897">And I think that's right. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=898">Probably conceptually, you know, if I had to explain it to my 11 year old, I would pick </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=903">bubble sort. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=904">But if you're working in Python, you should of course use the built in sorted algorithm </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=909">that you used to, unless you have like a super good reason not to, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=914">And then if you ask it, you know, is TimSort a simple algorithm? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=917">It says, no, it's not a simple algorithm. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=921">But is it simple to use correctly? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=923">Yes, it's very simple to use correctly, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=928">Unless you have a comparison function like the other day in the advent of code, which </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=931">it was less simple to use correctly. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=933">But anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that as our tools get better, the boundary </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=938">between simple and complex changes. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=940">So how easy a solution is to implement and scale depends a great deal on the tools and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=945">abstractions you have for working with it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=947">With a tapering jig, it's simple to implement and scale making tapered legs. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=952">If you don't have a jig like that, it's not so simple. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=955">With the Python standard library, it's simple to use a stable hybrid merge insertion sort, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=959">which is what TimSort is. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=961">You know, in other languages, it's not so simple. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=964">So I saw an interesting tweet about this from the CEO of AngelList Venture. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=967">He says, why use AngelList to run a fund? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=970">He says, my answer, AngelList abstracts away all the complexity. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=973">So he said it was starting and running a fund. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=976">And so I found that phrase really interesting, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=978">It's not that it eliminates the complexity. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=981">Complexity can't be gotten rid of. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=983">But it abstracts it all away and gives you an API where for the most part, you don't </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=988">have to worry about it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=989">And from your perspective, it's much simpler. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=992">So sometimes things can be simple, not because they lack complexity, but because complexity </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=997">has been abstracted away. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=999">And so, you know, I guess the lesson here is that as you're doing data science or machine </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1004">learning or software engineering or data engineering, whatever, think about ways to abstract away </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1010">the complexity. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1011">Sometimes that can be, you know, just using pre-trained models and user-friendly libraries. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1015">Sometimes you might want to create your own shared product, project templates, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1020">crafting clean APIs, using engineering best practices and using shared processes. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1027">And then if you do that, you can use complex machinery in a norm-conf way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1035">So there was a survey that was floating around the other day about ML and AI practices where </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1040">like a third of the people said they were using natural language understanding, but </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1043">only a third of those people said they were using transformers. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1046">And now, you know, maybe they didn't know because they say, oh, I use Hugging Face. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1050">I don't know. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1052">But when I see that, I think, wow, that's, you know, two-thirds of the people using natural </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1057">language understanding are probably not getting as good results as they could with the same </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1062">amount of work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1063">So, you know, you have my blessing to go import transformers and go nuts, and I won't criticize </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1069">you. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1071">And even Chad GPDT knows this one, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1074">If you ask it, what's the simplest way to solve a text classification problem, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1077">it's just a bag of words. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1078">But then it says another option is to use a pre-trained language model to generate embeddings </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1082">for each document and then train a classifier for these embeddings. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1086">So take it from Chad GPDT. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1088">That's a simple way to solve the problem. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1091">This is one of the woodworking YouTubers that I follow. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1095">He put out a video pretty recently about making a simple, elegant table. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1097">And of course, I saw the word simple and like it keyed with me. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1101">And you know, he said simplicity is something that sometimes we only discover through experience </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1106">and with confidence. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1108">And that resonated with me, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1109">Like knowing what the complexity, what the complex parts and the simple parts are is </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1114">how you know how to abstract those complex parts away and leave yourself with something </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1118">simple to work with. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1122">And so I'll leave you with a quote by Lao Tzu about abstracting complexity away. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1128">It's not really about that, but there aren't too many quotes about abstracting complexity </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1132">away. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1133">Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, have few desires. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1138">So manifest plainness, that means don't put too many stickers on your laptop. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1143">There's too many, take them off. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1146">Reduce selfishness, that means don't hog all the GPUs, share them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1149">Other people need to use them too. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1150">Everyone needs to train machine learning models. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1155">Have few desires, I don't really understand this one. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1157">I don't know. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1158">Someone can explain it to me later. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1159">I don't get it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1160">And then embrace simplicity, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1163">So if there's a moral to this talk, it's maybe that simplicity isn't simple. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1168">Things that seem simple sometimes aren't, and things that seem complex might actually </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1171">be a simpler choice. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1174">So thank you. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1175">I'm Joel. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1176">You can find me on Twitter. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1177">Everyone keeps saying that Twitter is dying. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1178">It's not dying. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1179">It's still there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1180">It's like the same as always, pretty much. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1181">So I'm still there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW9oVxjJHEw&t=1184">And that's that. </a>
