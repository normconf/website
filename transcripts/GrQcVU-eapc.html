        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=0">Thank you, everyone, for watching my talk. Data is the new coffee. I am Peter Baumgartner, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=6">and I am just going to dive right into it. So I'm a machine learning engineer at Explosion. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=13">We created the spacey natural language processing library and the prodigy annotation tool. I </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=19">also lead our consulting services, so I work on various applied natural language processing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=24">problems. And often those problems involve the process of annotating data, which is also </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=30">called labeling or coding data. For those of you not familiar, there's an example here </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=36">on this page. In this image, we have a common natural language processing task called named </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=40">entity recognition, where we're looking to identify entities and their types within a </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=45">piece of text. So right now we have models that can do a pretty good job at this task. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=51">But the reason we have those powerful models that can make predictions about entities is </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=56">because people have done the work to annotate thousands of documents with named entities </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=60">like this one. So one part of my talk is going to be talking about this process and exploring </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=66">this question of where does our data for machine learning come from? Specifically, what's this </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=71">process that transforms unlabeled raw data by adding annotations or labels for supervised </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=77">learning tasks? But we're going to get a little weird. We're going to take a winding road </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=83">to answer that question, because first we have to talk about coffee. So I love drinking </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=88">and learning about coffee. The idea for this talk came from this book on the right here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=93">It's a sort of manuscript, a very long exploration into the world of professional coffee tasting. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=102">And as I was reading, I noticed there were just a lot of similarities between the world </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=106">of professional coffee tasting and what we do when we annotate data. It raised a lot </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=111">of interesting questions about coffee for me. It's like how does a bean travel thousands </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=115">of miles to end up in our cup without having defects? When we're at the store, how do we </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=121">actually know what kind of coffee we're buying? How does a coffee taster convert these raw </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=125">taste perceptions into a quantitative and qualitative assessment of that coffee that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=130">can be shared? Who came up with the descriptions that we see on coffee bags and menus and how </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=134">did they do that? So my twist on the norm comp theme here is illustrating that I think </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=141">there's a lot we can learn from these mundane, habitual, very normy tasks like drinking coffee. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=146">And so we'll start getting some answers to these questions about coffee by exploring </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=151">the world of professional coffee tasting and then see what we can adopt for data annotation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=160">So a typical coffee tasting consists of sampling several coffees. Depending on the purpose </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=165">of the tasting, this can result in a description of their flavors, assigning numeric values </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=170">to the qualities of the coffee like bitterness or acidity, and tasting for any defects in </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=175">the coffee. We'll see an example of this in a bit. This is a screen cap on the slide from </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=181">a video that was the world's largest coffee tasting, which was a virtual event put on </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=185">by YouTuber James Hoffman, who I'd strongly recommend if you're at all interested in coffee. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=190">In this video, he's doing part of this virtual tasting and he's tasting five different coffees </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=195">that have been prepared in the same way with a process that's formally called cupping, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=199">which is different than how you typically brew coffee for consumption. You know, one </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=203">difference being that you actually are going to slurp the coffee from a spoon like he's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=208">doing here. So on the right hand side of the frame here, there's a sheet for taking notes </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=213">and scoring the coffee. And this is where the magic happens as tasters annotate their </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=219">experience and convert it into structured data. Often tasters will use a structured </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=227">form or a protocol like this one from the Specialty Coffee Association. There's a lot </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=232">going on here. So I'm just going to split up this form into four different parts. So </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=237">one thing that's happening is they're doing a numeric assessment of flavor characteristics. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=241">So we've got fragrance, aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body. There's some descriptive notes </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=248">of the flavors. So this one is very floral, silky body, beautiful aftertaste, extremely </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=254">balanced. There are checkboxes for any defects that are noted in the coffee. And then there's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=262">a final score that's basically the sum of all the points minus some points for any defects. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=268">So coffee tasters completing this form and doing a tasting is similar to annotating data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=273">And the benefit for us is that they've been doing it for a long time and have these established </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=278">methodologies that appear to be working. So now I'd like to transition into talking about </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=284">practices in professional coffee tasting that I believe can be of service to those of us </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=288">who rely on annotated data for data science. I'm going to talk about five different practices </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=294">that exist within the world of coffee tasting and draw some analogies to annotation. All </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=302">right. So first up is this idea of calibration and agreement. So professional coffee tasting </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=310">sessions usually begin with a day of what's called calibration. What happens here is before </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=315">evaluations and descriptions are formally recorded, tasters work together to come to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=320">a sense of agreement on what various descriptors and scale values mean. This is important because </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=325">everyone has different backgrounds and tasting abilities and experiences that are going to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=329">merit the need for calibration. If everyone is proposing their own idea of what an 8.5 </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=335">for flavor means, a large value of the, a large part of the value of tasting is going </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=340">to be lost due to that inconsistency. There was an interesting example of this in the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=346">book that I mentioned. So typically when the descriptor orange is used in North America </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=352">by coffee tasters, it refers sort of straightforwardly to the flavor of the orange fruit. However, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=360">tasters from India typically use the descriptor orange as an iconic descriptor where it essentially </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=366">serves as a substitute for the idea of good flavor. So this is just one of many examples </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=372">of how interpretation and judgment being in can be influenced by sort of local characteristics </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=377">of a tasting. So luckily with annotated data and with digital information, we have a way </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=383">to measure how much people agree on the annotations and the labels. This is the idea that is called </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=390">inner annotator agreement or inter-rater reliability. And these are measures that you can calculate </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=396">when you have multiple annotators labeling the same set of examples. When you're starting </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=400">a new project and you don't know how difficult your annotation task is, agreement metrics </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=405">can provide extremely valuable information. If two humans can't agree on how something </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=410">should be labeled, your model isn't going to output consistent results and you and your </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=414">users want consistent results. Additionally, you're going to bias your training dataset </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=419">based off the individual whims of your annotators. So like imagine if we had a magical machine </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=424">learning model to predict whether coffee had orange flavor or not. If half the data sets </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=428">annotated with North American tasters and half with tasters from India, what is it exactly </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=434">that we'd expect that model to produce? So starting a project with multiple annotators, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=441">calculating agreement metrics and revising your project based on agreement, to me, seems </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=445">like a cheat code for successful machine learning projects. As an example of this, here's a </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=450">chart displaying an agreement metric called Cohen's kappa and the F1 scores for that model </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=456">for a model trained on Google's Go Emotions dataset. Vincent covered this dataset a little </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=461">bit in his talk. I think this dataset is sort of like a mini dumpster fire, but one of the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=467">good things that they did do was have multiple annotators and calculated agreement measures </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=473">on their annotations. So the goal of this task, just as a refresher, they're classifying </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=479">Reddit comments into one of 27 emotion categories. So each dot here is the agreement score for </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=485">a single emotion category on the horizontal axis and then the F1 score from that model </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=490">on the vertical axis. So there's super high correlation here. So hopefully it's clear </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=495">that having multiple annotators and calculating these agreement metrics can tell you kind </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=500">of early if your model's going to be trash. So if you agree with me that agreement metrics </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=508">are awesome and you're using them on a project and find out you have a sort of poorly performing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=513">task with low agreement, what is it exactly that you would be fixing? So we'll talk about </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=519">that as it relates to structure and process. So we saw that in coffee tasting, they have </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=524">this form, this protocol. The form guides tasters towards what aspects of the coffee </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=530">to pay attention to and how to pay attention to them. Coffee tasters also go through years </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=535">of training and refining their perceptions and descriptions of taste. Essentially, there's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=540">just a deliberate effort to document and scale this task of tasting coffees and making sure </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=545">this process is as shareable and consistent as possible. So here's another example of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=554">a tool that provides some structure. This is a flavor wheel. I know it's too small for </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=558">you to read anything. Don't care about the details or go Google flavor wheel when you </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=562">have more time. This one's from counterculture coffee and what it does is just lists out </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=567">common descriptors or flavors in coffee in a hierarchical manner. So it's just a nice </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=571">tool that coffee tasters can use. So for projects needing data annotation, the equivalent tool </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=578">to the cupping form or something like a tasting wheel are called annotation guidelines. So </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=584">annotation guidelines serve as your reference for how data should be annotated or labeled. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=590">Here's an example of one from I just Googled annotation guidelines. There's this time ML </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=596">project. And essentially, this is just a specification for marking up temporal events within text. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=601">So, their annotation guidelines include detailed descriptions of all their tags, instructions </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=606">on how to annotate with them, and most importantly, numerous examples of annotated texts. So, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=613">without guidelines, it's difficult to know exactly what you're evaluating when you do </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=617">something like a model evaluation. Your model could be performing poorly because of inconsistencies </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=622">in your annotations on your training or your evaluation data sets. Now, this isn't a document </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=629">that you need to have perfectly defined when you start a project. Your annotation guidelines </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=633">can be developed iteratively over the course of the project and then solidify over time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=639">You really want them to be finalized, though, by the time you're annotating what we usually </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=642">call like your gold or your test data set. And you also want to be sure that you're reapplying </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=647">those finalized guidelines to your training data for consistency. So, speaking of iteration, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=655">let's talk a little bit about that. So, this one, I'm going straight to the example. Here's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=664">a bag of coffee I had a few months ago. I've highlighted the profile of this coffee on </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=669">the bag. And it says it is apple, toffee, and milk chocolate with a medium juicy body. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=676">So, a natural question here is, you know, is the flavor of apple actually in this coffee </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=684">once I brew it and taste it? Is it my job to extract this inherent taste sensation from </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=690">my experience while drinking the coffee? And that's certainly one way to think of drinking </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=694">coffee as a task. But tasting notes in this profile here can also serve as a jumping off </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=700">point for additional discoveries. So, rather than being a specific experience I'm trying </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=706">to extract, this apple flavor can be used as a jumping off point for additional discoveries. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=711">I might think of the flavor of apple, have a sip and try to locate that flavor and fail </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=715">to do that. But that experience can lead me towards another flavor that I can experience </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=720">more clearly. So, I could use that experience the next time I take a sip and see if there's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=726">something more clear that comes through. This is the idea of operating reflexively. It's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=730">like bootstrapping your experience by adopting an initial task and then, like, revising it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=735">in a cyclical process. So, we can adopt this same reflexivity in </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=742">annotation and labeling data. If you have a new dataset and a new task and the concept </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=749">or idea in which you're annotating is still sort of not well defined, you don't have to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=754">have your annotation scheme finalized or a production ready model in order to use those </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=758">tools to help you explore the problem space. You can just make up an annotation task for </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=763">yourself that will give you exposure to the data and experience with translating this </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=767">raw sort of data information into a structured task. It's fine to start with something simple </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=774">and discover your task as actually something else along the way as you start to encounter </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=777">more and more data. Your goal here is to understand the data through this process. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=784">Another place this reflexivity shows up is with model in the loop workflows. In this </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=788">case, you will have trained an existing model that's making predictions on the data that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=793">you're annotating. Here, the reflexivity stems from using these models, the model's predictions, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=799">to better understand what type of data you might additionally collect or annotate. In </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=803">short, you can perform a simplified task or intermediate version of your final task as </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=808">a stepping stone to your final solution. You know, don't expect to get it right the first </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=812">time. So this very formal protocol-based testing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=822">isn't the only kind of tasting around. There are actually three different sort of categories </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=829">of tasting. I've covered descriptive tasting, which is this long process with the form. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=836">There's also discriminatory tasting, which is like tasting for defects. And there's also </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=842">hedonic tasting, which is just discovering whether a taster personally likes or dislikes </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=847">a coffee. So these different tasting tasks get employed strategically, and we should </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=853">be thankful for that. As lay tasters, we don't want to complete an entire form to determine </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=859">if we enjoy a cup of coffee that we brewed in the morning. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=865">Flexibility is important because it helps you not waste time solving the wrong problem. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=870">On the left here are examples of two types of defects in coffee beans, insect damage </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=874">and fully black beans, which usually result from environmental issues like frost. Fortunately, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=880">these can be visually inspected for issues before the coffee is tasted. But if the process </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=885">didn't include that task of checking for defects, you know, these beans could get all the way </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=889">to an actual tasting, and we'd have people wasting their time with the wrong task, which </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=894">is tasting coffee when there are known defects. In the same way, you have to think about the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=899">suitability of your annotation task relative to sort of like the use case for your model </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=905">and the limitations of your data. So my favorite task to pick on, of course, is sentiment analysis. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=911">So let's say we wanted to know whether a movie review was positive or negative. I've got </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=916">a real life example here from the movie Birdman, which I love. So this is just a paragraph </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=921">from that review. Now, most sentiment models would just classify this text as negative. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=928">And we can work with this coarse sense of sentiment if it's valuable for our product </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=932">to know generally how much people enjoy a movie. But if we're interested in a more nuanced </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=937">characteristics of the movie, like the quality of the musical score or the cinematography </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=943">or the strength of the weakness of the acting, you know, a broad sense of sentiment isn't </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=947">going to help us answer those questions. So here's an example of a paragraph later on </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=951">in that same review that actually was overall positive talking about the cinematography </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=957">of the movie. So you have to align your raw data, your annotations and your use case and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=963">make sure all these things sort of line up and that you're solving a suitable task. Another </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=968">point here is that that other people have mentioned is that you should always be assessing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=972">whether machine learning and supervised learning specifically is the right approach for your </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=977">system. You should be thinking about machine learning as one component of a larger system, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=982">not your whole system in itself. In the same way, you know, it's not the job of coffee </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=986">tasters to determine the tasting notes that appear on a bag of coffee or the description </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=992">you might see in a coffee shop or how a blend might be successfully marketed. Instead, they're </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=997">focused on trying to describe the coffee as objectively as possible and in a standardized </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1002">way. All right. My last point is this idea of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1011">full stack collaboration. I apologize if this sounds like a weird management consultant </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1017">buzzword, but it was the best thing I could come up with. So hear me out. So coffee farmers </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1023">don't often taste their own coffees, actually. Typically, they're just trying to achieve </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1027">the highest yield, which just means the lowest number of defects. So generally, there's not </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1033">a lot of interest in positive taste characteristics. So farmers don't know exactly what they're </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1038">selling a lot of times. This is one of the areas that people in the coffee industry are </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1043">actually trying to change so that farmers can better understand what it is they're selling </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1047">and improve their crops. And in the same way, I think machine learning </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1054">projects kind of have some sort of communication and collaboration risk if this whole sort </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1059">of team pipeline isn't working correctly and not everyone understands what the other one </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1065">is doing. So the risk here is having a project that's sort of too heavily focused on one </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1070">team in this diagram. So focusing on the left, I sort of have this thought that a lot of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1076">when you look at a lot of organizations attempting to do machine learning or some research projects, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1081">they think the real problem is trying to find a cost effective annotation team and getting </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1085">data labeled for as cheaply as possible. And on the other end of the spectrum, you have </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1091">spaces like Kaggle competitions that are framed in this sort of like, sterile product management </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1096">business problem perspective, like you just get a problem and they want you to bring the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1101">data science and you can't ask that company to annotate more data or provide additional </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1105">context. And then finally, you know, data scientists </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1109">and machine learning engineers or whatever you are, my green screen is tipping over now </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1114">because I'm stepping on it. Whether you're a machine learning engineer or data scientist, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1120">we're also just as guilty as this, too. I know numerous times, like, I just want to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1123">get to coding. I'll just download a pre-trained model, get the data set and just go to town. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1129">And that is to my own detriment later, I've found numerous times. So, you know, there's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1134">downsides of focusing too much on one of these groups. If data science doesn't have insight </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1139">into the annotation task, you can waste a lot of time on a task that might make logical </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1143">sense and have good annotation guidelines, but be poorly executed or result in a data </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1147">set that's just not workable with machine learning. The data science team also needs </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1152">to help incorporate model in the loop workflows to perform error analysis and perform error </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1157">analysis on early iterations of the model so the task can be refined. Data science also </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1165">needs to communicate with the product team. It's unlikely that the things that machine </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1169">learning can do out of the box with a pre-trained model or framework is going to be a direct </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1173">solution to your business problem. And it's important to have product involved in the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1179">annotation task because the things that you annotate are going to be the outputs of the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1183">system. You need to be sure that those outputs are relevant and meaningful to the product </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1186">that you're developing. I would say it's not out of the question for everyone on any of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1191">these teams to annotate data at some point in a project life cycle. I think the best </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1195">way to understand the details of the data and the annotations relative to each team's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1200">goals is to actually do that process. So by neglecting to think about where our coffee </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1209">comes from and sort of this process of coffee tasting, I think we're missing out on, you </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1215">know, delightful coffee experiences and aspects of our coffee that we weren't aware that we </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1220">could enjoy. And in the same way, I think we're missing out on a lot when we ignore </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1224">where our data comes from and fail to implement processes that make it better. It's not enough </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1230">to accept your data as a given of a project and move on. If we care a little bit more </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1235">about where our data comes from and how our data gets annotated, I think we can also have </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrQcVU-eapc&t=1240">more successful and more delightful data science projects. Thank you. </a>
