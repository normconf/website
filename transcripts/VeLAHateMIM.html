        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=0">So my academic background is physics and astronomy. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=4">I moved into data science about eight or nine years ago. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=8">I've worked as a data science practitioner. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=11">And then as of about three years ago, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=12">I transitioned to working as a, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=15">like a data science tool builder. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=16">So I work now at Posit, formerly RStudio, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=20">where I work on open source software </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=23">for modeling machine learning, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=24">and now MLOps for Python and R. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=28">And one of the things that I think is a theme </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=30">through my career, like a kind of connecting idea, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=34">is that I'm very interested in people's practical workflows </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=39">and how people do their real work, what makes it hard. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=43">I'm thinking about systems, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=44">like how do people use systems to get their work done? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=48">And that's been, you know, whether I've been working </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=50">as a data science practitioner in an organization, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=53">working on, you know, text analysis tools, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=56">or more recently as I've been focusing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=58">on machine learning tools. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=60">So given that, when I saw this tweet, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=63">which has been in a bunch of talks already, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=66">well, when this tweet from Vicky had this phrase in it, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=72">how many K-folds is too many? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=74">I saw this and my immediate reaction was, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=77">oh, but I actually wanna give a talk about that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=79">Like, I actually want to talk to people about that, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=82">because one of the tools that I think </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=87">we don't hear enough about, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=90">that can be super helpful in many situations, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=93">is the tool to answer this kind of question. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=96">And it's in my title, it's not a spoiler, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=99">to say like that tool is simulations, building simulations. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=102">I feel like in data work, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=105">we don't see blog posts about it, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=108">you don't hear about it as a tool to use. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=110">And honestly, what is more normy, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=113">what is more norm-conf than just like doing the same thing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=117">thousands of times, and you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=118">like I just have to do the same thing over and over </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=120">to figure something out. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=123">So I specifically wanna talk about </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=125">how simulation is a powerful tool. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=127">I'll like, why is it powerful? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=129">It's powerful because it helps us </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=130">make our assumptions concrete. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=134">Assumptions I have in my brain, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=135">assumptions that my collaborators have in their brains, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=139">how can we make it concrete? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=140">How can we get on the same page </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=142">with people that we're working with about trade-offs? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=145">You know, some of us may be thinking, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=146">oh, it will be better if we do it like this, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=148">it will be better if we do it like this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=149">Often there are trade-offs between those decisions, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=152">and simulations help us understand what they are </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=155">and get on the same page with each other. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=157">And ultimately simulation helps us like, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=159">make better decisions by, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=162">be through these kinds of various things. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=164">So let, so I have, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=169">one of the big projects I have been working on </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=171">in recent years is called Tidy Models. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=173">So Tidy Models is a framework in R </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=177">for modeling and machine learning </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=179">using tidy verse principles. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=180">I'm gonna show you some, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=181">there is gonna be like code on the screen here </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=183">and it's gonna be mostly tidy models code. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=186">So I'm excited for you get to see it, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=187">but really this is not a talk about tidy models </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=191">or because what we're talking about more </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=193">is how to use simulation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=194">And I think the, hopefully the way we talk </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=196">through some of these ideas, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=198">even if you use a different, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=200">usually use a different framework for machine learning </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=203">or your data work or like different, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=206">whatever language or framework you like to use, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=208">hopefully this will be applicable here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=211">So let's jump in, let's jump into this question. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=213">This first question, how many folds is too many? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=216">This is a question about predictive modeling, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=218">supervised machine learning, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=220">kind of the sort of like classical, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=222">I have inputs, I wanna predict outputs. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=224">And the purpose of folds, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=227">of making cross-validation folds </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=229">is to estimate the performance of a model, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=233">to be able to say how well a model </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=235">or a model configuration or hyper parameter configuration, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=238">how well is it performing? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=241">So to do this, we need some data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=243">How are you gonna get this data? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=244">I'm gonna talk through this talk </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=246">about a couple of different ways that you can approach this, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=248">but one way is to use an existing function </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=250">that is meant for simulations. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=252">These are out there, go looking for them in the frameworks </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=257">and languages that you're comfortable with. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=259">Here's a function that simulates data </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=261">for our regression model. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=263">It's got, down here we can see it's got 20 predictors, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=266">one outcome, like the idea is we predict the outcome </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=269">from these predictors, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=269">just like with whatever kind of regression we wanna use. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=273">We can look up in the docs, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=274">how the outcomes are related to the predictors. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=278">And like, this is one way you can get started </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=280">kind of in a straightforward way with simulations, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=284">especially the simulation is kind of about a general </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=287">kind of modeling problem or machine learning </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=289">kind of practice you wanna get to, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=291">look for one of these functions. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=292">So once we have that, we can, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=295">since we're interested in how many folds, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=297">we can create folds. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=298">So as a very brief memory jog or reminder, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=303">V-fold cross-validation or also called K-fold cross-validation </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=308">is where you need to take your data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=309">Remember, we had a thousand because I said, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=312">give me a thousand, we have a thousand observations. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=315">Let's divide this into K-folds. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=318">The default in tidy models is to use 10 folds. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=321">So let's divide it into 10 folds. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=323">And then let's create a whole set of resamples </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=326">where we hold out one of those folds, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=329">all the rest of them go together. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=331">We train on the nine folds and estimate performance </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=334">from the 10 that's held out or the 100. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=336">That's the 100 observations, the one fold that's held out. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=341">Then we slide it down. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=343">Now this one's held out. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=344">We train on these nine folds, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=346">estimate performance using this one held out fold. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=350">And we slide on down here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=351">So that was a little reminder of what V-fold </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=355">or K-fold cross-validation is. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=357">So how the default is, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=359">how the default is 10. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=362">You'll see 10 as a default a lot. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=363">How do I know that's the right number? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=365">So let's go through some steps. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=367">So how we can find that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=368">So I've made folds. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=370">What I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna fit a model </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=372">to these folds. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=374">So I am going to fit a basic random forest </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=376">using all those predictors. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=378">I'm gonna fit it to the fold </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=379">and then I'm gonna extract out some metrics. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=381">Let's just use some default metrics </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=383">that are good for regression, RMSE and R-squared here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=386">So this is me fitting one model </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=391">to each of the folds 10 times </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=393">and getting results out </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=394">that tell me the performance of this model </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=397">with the default of 10. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=399">So, but I gotta do this a bunch of times. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=402">I'm gonna use simulations to do this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=403">So almost always when I'm writing simulations, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=407">I start with like the small problem and then build up. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=410">So let's start building up and write a function </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=412">that will let me do this a whole bunch of times. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=415">So what this function does is first </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=417">it generates a new simulated data set, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=421">divides that new simulated data set </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=423">into cross-validation fold, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=424">fits this basic random forest model to it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=427">and then collects the metrics. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=428">And so here, what you're seeing is that I have said, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=431">okay, give me a thousand rows of data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=434">What do I get if I have V equals three? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=436">So before I showed you V equals 10, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=438">here's V equals three. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=439">So what I wanna do now is I wanna now scale this up </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=442">and I want to be able to test </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=445">lots of different kinds of values. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=447">So here is where I'm gonna do that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=448">I'm gonna set up different values of V. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=452">So I'm doing this from four to 24 </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=454">and I'm stepping forward by two. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=456">And I'm gonna do my simulation 100 times </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=461">at each one of these. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=462">So at the four level, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=464">I'm doing four fold cross-validation 100 times. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=467">At the 24th and I'll do 24 fold cross-validation </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=472">and I'll do that 100 times. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=474">And then I'll take these values, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=476">I can map across them, applying my function </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=479">and then get out the metrics that I have. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=482">So here is the part, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=483">this is the first thing that I'm putting on the screen here </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=486">that actually ran long enough </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=488">that I might wanna like get up and do something else, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=491">go check whatever social media is doing these days. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=496">And so I wanna speak, I put efficient in the title </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=498">because when you think about simulation, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=502">this is not usually something that's gonna be deployed </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=504">in a production environment and needs really low latency. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=507">We don't need to think about efficiency in that way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=509">What you need to think about efficiency </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=511">when it comes to simulation </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=513">is how well can you use the tools that you have </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=515">to get going and is it, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=518">like I don't think it's important </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=519">that a simulation is over optimized, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=521">but it is able to finish in a time that is useful to you </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=524">on your analysis timeframe. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=525">All right, so now that we've got this, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=527">let's make a little bit of a visualization to see. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=529">So I'm gonna focus on RMSE. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=531">I could have instead chosen R squared </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=533">if I prefer to use that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=534">And then I'm computing the variance of the RMSE. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=539">So this is the median, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=541">what's about to be on the plot is the median RMSE variance </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=546">of these different values here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=548">And so this is what the plot that this makes. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=550">So you can see, we start with high variance, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=552">the RMSE that we get, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=554">we don't, it has, it's jumping up and down a lot. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=559">It goes down very steeply and then it starts tapering off. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=562">So if I look at this plot and I kind of say, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=564">oh, am I gonna look for an elbow here? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=567">I'm gonna say there's an elbow maybe around, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=572">maybe around 10, maybe around 12. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=574">And so this is where you start to be able to see </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=577">what kind of trade-offs are involved </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=578">in any kind of decision that we may make. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=580">We can look at this, talk about with our collaborators </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=582">and decide what kind of trade-off do we wanna make </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=585">between how long it takes us </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=587">to estimate the performance of our models </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=589">and how kind of like how many diminishing returns we get </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=593">by bumping up and up in V. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=596">So we did it, I answered the question, fantastic. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=599">What if you have another question? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=601">What if you wanna say, so that was variance. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=603">What, how does bias change as you change </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=606">the number of folds? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=608">The answer is you should run a simulation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=611">Spoiler alert, 10 is about the right number as well </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=614">for bias, it gives you kind of a good balance in results. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=617">What if you have more or less data? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=620">So I showed you examples with a thousand data points. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=624">What if you actually are using, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=625">working with quite small data </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=626">or you have something more in the 50,000 or 100,000 </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=629">or very large range? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=631">Well, you can run a simulation and see how does it change </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=634">as you change the size of the dataset. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=636">Spoiler alert, it doesn't really change that much. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=640">Like that relationship with variance specifically. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=643">What if you're gonna use a different model? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=644">Like I use random forest here, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=646">but there's tons of different options out there </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=648">that you might use in this sort of classic </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=651">supervised machine learning kind of environment, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=654">or you could use deep learning here as well. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=657">Just run a simulation and you can find, does it change? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=660">What is the right answer for you? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=662">Spoiler alert, this actually doesn't really depend </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=664">on what kind of model it is. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=665">So you don't, you actually will see </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=667">kind of something kind of flat here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=669">What if you're interested in doing repeated cross validation? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=672">This is where I do 10 fold. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=674">I had like make 10 folds. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=676">I go back to my initial data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=677">I make 10 folds again. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=678">I go back to my data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=679">I make 10 folds again. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=680">You could maybe do that like five repeats </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=683">of 10 fold cross validation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=686">That gives you actually 50 folds, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=687">but the folds are only shuffled within each time </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=690">that you do it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=691">And then you repeat it, repeat it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=692">Here actually you can get to a bit of a different place </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=695">in terms of bias and variance. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=697">So when you ran this simulation, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=698">you would be able to understand, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=700">okay, if I'm willing to invest five more times time, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=705">computational time, what can I get out </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=708">in terms of bias and variance? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=709">You can get out some significant improvements. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=711">What if say you wanted to use the bootstrap </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=714">instead of V fold cross validation? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=717">You can run a simulation that compares them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=720">And here again, I'll tell you a little bit of the answer. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=724">It turns out that you end up with different trade-offs </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=726">in terms of bias and variance. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=728">Bootstrap tends to be low, variance, high bias, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=732">cross fold validation tends to be low bias, higher variance. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=737">So, but you can find this out. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=738">You don't have to take my word for it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=739">You can run a simulation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=741">Okay, so this was sort of the first question </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=746">and then walking through how you might answer, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=748">how you might ask other questions with a similar simulation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=751">Let's walk to a different kind of question </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=754">away from how many folds is too many. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=755">And let's ask the question, how many observations do we need? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=760">So let's say you are working on some product </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=764">that is just newly launched. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=765">And it is important to you to understand the relationship </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=768">with two predictors and an outcome </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=770">that's important to your business. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=773">You though suspect or maybe know </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=776">that there is an interaction between those two predictors. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=779">Like the value of one predictor changes the relationship </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=784">between the other predictor and the outcome. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=786">This is called interaction in statistics. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=789">And you don't know what the effect size is. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=792">Let's say it comes for this new product </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=794">that you're like starting to roll out. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=796">People are starting to use it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=797">It is important to your business to know </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=800">what is the effect size of this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=803">And so you are going to run an experiment </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=806">and you're gonna collect data </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=807">and build a model and understand this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=810">You know, a lot of you are probably hearing this </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=811">and you're saying, ah, yes, I AB test. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=814">Effect size calculator, this is a power calculation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=819">If I'm asking the question, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=820">how many observations do I need </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=822">in order to be able to do something? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=824">Though all those AB test calculators </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=826">that are out there though, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=827">they typically only work for the most straightforward case. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=831">Like you're gonna do a T-test at the end. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=833">If what you wanna do is some more complex kind of model </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=836">and you need to know how many things you have to have </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=839">to start with, then to be able to get the answer that, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=842">to be able to find out the answer that you're looking for, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=844">what you need to do there is a simulation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=846">You might call it a power simulation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=848">So let's walk through real, I'm just gonna, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=850">you know, don't worry too much about the details here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=852">Do notice though that I'm writing a function from scratch now </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=857">to generate the data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=859">So I'm basically, what I'm doing here </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=861">is I'm making my assumptions concrete </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=864">in the way that I did, I said at the beginning, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=866">I say, okay, I've got two predictors that are random normal. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=871">And then I am gonna make explicit my assumption </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=875">about the relationships between the predictors </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=877">that I have in the outcomes and how they are in fact, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=880">how they in fact interact with each other. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=882">So this gives us, when I call it, say with these, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=886">as for a given, you know, a given assumption </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=890">about the effect size, I can get out some simulated data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=893">So I take this function, I do something similar to what, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=896">so I can run it one time, I get a data, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=899">I can, you know, do the kind of model </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=901">that I might actually use to analyze the data here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=906">And notice, and then I can deal with the output. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=909">So notice what, that here, the interaction term </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=912">is the effect size that I estimate from the model </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=916">is not very big and the P value is kind of large </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=920">compared to the estimates on the linear coefficients. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=926">This is really common with outcome, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=928">with interaction terms and why it can be, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=929">you know, like it is a little more complicated </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=931">to be able to detect an interaction between two things. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=936">I'm using, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=937">as a straightforward linear model here, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=938">but you could imagine doing this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=940">If you're gonna take an approach </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=941">where you're gonna use a more complicated model, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=943">like a hierarchical model or mixed level model </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=946">or a fully Bayesian model or something, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=947">you can just put that into here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=949">So let's take these little bits </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=951">and wrap it up into a function. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=953">So in the function, what we do here, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=955">we make a dataset, fit the model, get out the output. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=959">And then ask, here at the bottom, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=964">what this is doing is it is saying, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=967">when I say summarize, like the significance, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=970">P value less than 0.5, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=971">what this is saying is how often do I detect the, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=976">how often am I able to detect the interaction term? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=979">I'm still able to measure it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=980">And so if I run this a hundred times </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=983">for an effect size of 0.1, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=986">or in a sample size of 100, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=990">I detect it 40% of the time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=993">And that actually is exactly what power is. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=995">That right there is exactly what power is. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=997">So I can do it a bunch of times. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1000">So I am going to try different values of effect size. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1005">Maybe people have just started using this feature. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1009">And so what I want to do is I want to see </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1013">at what point will I have to, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1014">how many people will I have to observe </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1016">having taken this behavior to be able to detect </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1019">if this thing that's important to our business </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1021">has happened or not. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1022">And also how big does the, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1025">given our assumptions about how big the effect size might be, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1029">again, like when will I be able to detect it? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1032">So let's run this a bunch of times. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1034">Let's run it a thousand times </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1035">on all these different possible combinations </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1039">of numbers of samples and effect size. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1041">And so then I get results. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1043">Results are, I've done a power simulation here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1046">Let's make a quick visualization. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1049">And I get a result that looks like this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1050">So this is symmetric, which is good. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1053">We would be really surprised </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1054">if the interaction term going one way, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1060">we couldn't expect, we couldn't detect it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1062">if it went the other way too. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1063">So it's symmetric, which is very good. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1065">What's on the X-axis is the effect size. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1067">How big of an interaction is there? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1070">When, like, how much difference </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1072">does the value of one predictor make </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1075">on the relationship between the other predictor </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1077">and the outcome? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1078">So how big is the effect size? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1080">On the Y-axis is the power. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1082">So a typical statistical cutoff is 80%, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1085">meaning 80% of the time I would detect a real effect. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1090">And so if we say, okay, is it important to our business </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1093">if the effect size is less than, say, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1097">point, absolute value of 0.05? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1098">If the answer is no, then great. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1101">You know, we don't have to worry about there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1102">But let's say we decide for our business, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1104">actually, if the effect size has an absolute value </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1107">of greater than 0.05, then we can come to these lines </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1111">and we can look and say, okay, I'm gonna need, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1114">700, 900, 1,000 samples to be able to tell you that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1120">So this is an example of how to answer </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1124">a question using simulation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1126">We can make our assumptions concrete </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1128">and then are able to make a better decision </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1131">than we would otherwise. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1132">All right, in my last bit of time, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1134">I wanna talk about one other kind of question </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1136">you can answer with simulation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1139">And that is, so first we had how many folds are too many? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1143">We had how many observations do I need? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1147">And now how important is this relationship? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1150">The code that I've shown you so far </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1153">is all just like really basic tidy versus tidy models code </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1155">that you could do in any, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1157">in any language that you use, you could write it out. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1160">But here, this is a package that's a little bit more special. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1162">It's really unique idea. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1165">It's called the Nullabor package </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1166">and it is for graphical inference. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1169">So what this means is doing statistical inference visually. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1174">So let's simulate one more dataset. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1176">So it also, like before, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1178">is gonna have two predictors and an outcome. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1181">But the relationship now here is the predictor one </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1186">is linear, it's linearly related to the outcome. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1190">Predictor two is related with the log. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1194">So it does not, so the rate of it changing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1196">is very different, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1198">I feel like in many situations of interest, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1201">you end up with these log, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1203">with these power law relationships, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1205">Like with these, like power laws are everywhere around us </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1208">all the time, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1209">And so this is actually a fairly realistic thing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1211">that happened. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1212">And so often there are these relationships </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1214">that are power law relationships. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1216">And it can sometimes be hard to communicate to stakeholders, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1221">especially less technical stakeholders, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1223">what it really means when there is a power law </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1226">in something like, and what does that mean </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1227">in terms of our leverage of how easy it is to change? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1230">So let's just make some quick visualizations. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1232">Here's the linear one. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1234">Predictor one is on the X-axis. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1236">The outcome is on the X-axis. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1238">We can see that sort of linear change there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1241">Here's predictor two. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1242">It looks quite different, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1244">There's the absolute value there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1245">So that's what we have. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1246">We kind of see it going up in these different ways. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1248">But at these values, it's like, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1251">well, that one's a little more like a blob, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1254">A little bit more like a blob. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1256">So what the Null Abort Package lets you do </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1258">is it lets you make what's called a lineup. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1261">So this is like, the metaphor here is like, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1263">you've been taken to the police station </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1265">to go look at a lineup of possible criminals. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1267">And can you identify the one that you saw before? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1272">Like, is it possible for you to identify </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1274">the one that you saw before? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1275">So the kind of lineup that I'm gonna use now </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1278">is a permutation under the null hypothesis. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1283">So basically, what the kind of graphical inference </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1285">we're doing is, given the null hypothesis, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1289">is the, how unlikely is the effect that we're seeing? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1296">So yes, I'm talking about p-values. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1298">P-values done via visualization. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1301">So we're doing this simulation, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1302">Like we've talked about before, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1303">and then we're gonna get a visual p-value. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1307">So let's look at this, and everyone look at it, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1309">and then I'll drop a question. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1311">So if you all, I'm putting this </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1312">in the Ask the Speakers Slack channel. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1315">So if you wanna go in there and maybe thread it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1318">or something, which of these do you think </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1322">is the real relationship? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1325">Not the permuted one that was simulated, but the real one. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1330">Somebody go in and put in there what they think it is. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1338">I'll just wait for at least one person to go in. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1347">Yes, okay, I think this one's pretty easy to find. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1350">14 is the real one. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1351">14 is the one that is the real relationship, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1354">and the rest of them have gotten, are random, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1358">are just random. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1359">So if we did this over and over and over </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1362">with a lot of people, I actually can compute a p-value </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1365">with that because there's 20 here, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1367">like we can do this kind of thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1369">Let's now look at the next one. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1370">So this is the second predictor. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1373">This is the second predictor here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1374">Let's permute it, and let's see whether we can see it or not. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1380">So here is the second one. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1381">So let me just put this in here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1385">So which one in the lineup here do you think </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1387">is the real one versus the permuted random one? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1397">So take a look. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1399">I think this one's harder. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1401">I think this one is harder, but still possible. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1405">I think this one is harder, but still possible. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1410">And if I actually bump the standard deviation </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1412">up a little bit, you would actually not be able </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1414">to see it at all. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1415">Like literally, there would be no way </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1416">to be able to tell this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1418">But yes, yes, that's right. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1420">So this one is still two, which means it is actually </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1423">probably still statistically significant, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1425">and we can, like that it is different from random, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1428">and we are able to see it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1430">So what this, this is an example of a way to use simulation </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1435">with relationships that you may have in your real data </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1438">to be able to understand how important they are, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1442">be able to, and in a way that is very accessible </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1445">to people that you may need to communicate with about this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1450">It's a really helpful exercise. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1452">So like the rest of them, what that shows us </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1456">is how simulation can be this really powerful tool </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1459">to help us do these things. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1461">We are able to get out of our heads </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1464">and our collaborators' heads and into code, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1467">you know, the assumptions that we have, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1469">we're able to talk about trade-offs, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1471">see what the trade-offs really are, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1473">and ultimately make better decisions. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1475">So we're, I think almost all of us here are like data folks, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1478">right, and usually we try to use data to make decisions. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1482">So I think, again, I think there's almost more, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1485">nothing more like in the norm-conf ethos </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1489">than to say like, oh, I don't have any data </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1491">to make this decision, I will just make some up. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1495">But I think it's a sign of health </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1496">and a sign of using a tool that's available to us </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1499">to be able to do that, to be able to generate data </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1503">that helps us understand about trade-offs </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1505">and make things concrete. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1507">So with that, I will say thank you very much </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeLAHateMIM&t=1511">and see if we have any questions we wanna chat about. </a>
