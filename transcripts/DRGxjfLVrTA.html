        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=0">Picture this. It's two months until a conference for which you're an organizer and a speaker. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=7">You've got planning a band, community, donations, and finances to organize. You're a founding </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=12">hire at a seed stage startup, just moved to a new state, and also have life things to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=17">take care of. The smartest thing to do given all of this would be just to put your head </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=22">down and get things done. That's why when I faced this situation, the only natural thing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=27">to do was to use my time to build a production-grade API. What preceded was a lesson in tool choices, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=35">overengineering, and dedication to a meme. Thank you for coming to my talk about building </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=40">cheap HTTPS APIs. My name is Ben Labashian. I'm principal Emily at Work Helix and an organizer </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=46">for NormConf. Today, I want to walk you through the infrastructure and deployment process </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=51">for the NormConf goodies API. More than that, I want to speak with you about our most scarce </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=56">of resources, time. But before I start, some useful info for folks who want to follow along </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=63">at home. You can check out the goodies code repo above, and if you want to play around </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=68">with the NormConf API, head over to api.normconf.com. If you haven't heard about the API, this is </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=76">your chance to play around with the most useful, definitely need to have this above all other </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=80">conference priorities. Vicky, please let me have this API out there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=84">I mean, look at this thing. With a simple curl to api.normconf.com, you can get an ASCII-ified </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=93">NormConf logo. You know who hasn't made a conference API? NeurIPS. You know who hasn't </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=98">been invited to speak at NeurIPS? Me. Coincidence? Almost certainly. But we can at least agree </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=104">that this is all very important stuff. Still, there's a lot to cover, and I don't want to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=110">lose the forest for the trees, so I'm going to rip off the band-aid and tell you exactly </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=114">what the central message of this talk is now. You ready? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=119">We don't have enough time to do all the things we want or need to do in our jobs, let alone </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=125">our lives. So many of you, as with me, feel the weight of wanting to learn it all and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=132">do it all. We push ourselves every day, hoping to accomplish more. And we achieve great things. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=139">Clearly this conference wouldn't exist were it not for its head organizer being the type </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=144">of person to push themselves. If you're in this industry and you're listening to this </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=149">talk, I suspect you're like this, too. This type of mentality bleeds into our jobs just </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=155">as it seeps into our lives. As I said, I built the NormConf API while juggling many things, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=161">and yet I chose to build it. Having done so, I chose the tools I was familiar with. Some </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=167">of those were good choices. Others held me back. If I had chosen more wisely, the work </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=172">probably would have been done faster. So yes, this is a talk about having built the goodies </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=178">API, but it's a metaphor about the time we don't have, realistically or not, and the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=183">consequences of choosing the wrong tools for the job. So when I talk about building APIs </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=188">for cheap, I am actually referring to the tradeoffs we make among our resources, time, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=194">cognitive energy, and cost savings. Okay. Now that we've established that, here's how </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=200">it's going to work. First, I'll talk about the initial steps I took. Then I'll talk about </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=205">the aspects of software I like. I've called these aspects normy software. It's completely </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=211">made up, but I can do that because, again, this isn't a NeurIPS talk. Finally, I'll talk </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=216">about some pains of deploying APIs to the cloud. Today we're going to be talking about </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=220">AWS, but this easily could have been applied to any of the big cloud platforms. And that'll </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=226">be the talk. Okay. So let's get things started. So when I sat down to build the goodies API, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=233">there was no doubt in my mind what I was going to do. That's because as an MLE, I spend a </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=238">lot of time working with and building APIs. Most models, if they're going to be any good, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=244">have to be served. Someone or something needs to be able to interact with the model and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=248">its outputs. Now, data scientists of a certain type might build APIs for their models, but </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=254">oftentimes it's the MLEs who are tasked with building or refining them to become production </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=258">ready. That's the nature of the position. We are relied upon to know a lot of things </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=262">in order to solve many very different problems. That's why tooling choice is so important. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=270">As MLEs, we cannot afford to embed software into our systems that makes them unable to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=274">scale or that cause inefficiencies. Intuitively, most of us understand this. The problem is </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=280">it's hard to avoid bad tool choices in practice. Why? Well, when I went about building the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=286">goodies API, I stuck with what I know. Fast API, Docker, GitHub, AWS. These are my bread </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=293">and butter. I use them every day and being time pressed and trying to do everything at </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=298">once, I reached for them when I sat down to program. Here's a simple diagram that illustrates </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=303">what I imagined the goodies API would look like. To begin, I'd start with Python. Easy, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=308">functional, well supported. When it came to an API framework, I reached for fast API. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=313">It's my go-to framework for reasons I'll discuss soon. Next, Docker. It's ubiquitous, straightforward, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=319">gets the job done. After that, I'd push to Git, which would activate a GitHub action </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=324">CICD for testing and deployment. Finally, that would deploy the container straight to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=329">AWS, where it would be hosted in Elastic Container Service or ECS. In my mind, all of it can </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=335">be done in a day or two. And for the most part, it worked out. Because if you choose </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=339">your tools wisely, they make your job easier. That is, they are cheaper to use. Your tools </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=346">should make your job easier. Time is expensive. We have a lot to do. This brings me to my </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=352">next section of the talk. Normie software or the benefits of choosing good software </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=356">tools. As I've said, when I select my tools properly, I look out for what I'm calling </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=362">the qualities of normie software. There's not much to it. To be a normie software, a </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=367">tool has to have one or more of the following qualities. They do the thing they say they </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=374">do. They are an investment. They are easy to pick up. I'm going to be citing these tenets </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=381">throughout my talk. Keep an eye out. Let's break these down one by one. They do the thing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=387">they say they do. That is, a hammer hits things, an API creation tool creates APIs. That's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=393">what it does. If you're spending an inordinate amount of time trying to get a tool to the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=397">point that will accomplish your underlying goal, you should ask yourself, is that what </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=401">this tool is meant to do? Is there a better tool to get me there? Should I be creating </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=405">doc from scratch in Fortran or could I just find a better way? Next, they are an investment. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=414">An investment in yourself, in the current problem you're facing, and in future problems </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=419">that will also need to be solved. This one's hand wavy, so let me clarify. We've already </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=425">established that people in our field, in my case, MLEs, are required to solve different </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=429">time box problems which entail a significant cognitive load. These are costs. It's hard </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=436">to remember everything, let alone do all the things we do. If a tool is going to require </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=440">us to learn how to operate it, the time spent learning it becomes an investment if the tool </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=445">will also be used in future projects. You want your tools to scale. You want your time </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=452">to scale. That's what an investment, that's why it's an investment, and that's why I argue </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=458">you should view your time and tools as such. And most critically, they are easy to pick </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=466">up. That is, they do the hard work for you, thus making you want to use them. This one </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=472">I'd like to expand on a little bit more. There's an often cited quote by computer scientist </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=477">Tony Hoare. It says, the most important property of a program is whether it accomplishes the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=482">intentions of its user. Maybe you've heard this one floating around. Well, contextually, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=488">Hoare was writing in a paper about the axiomatic qualities of programs. And aptly, this was </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=493">the first sentence of a section called proofs of program correctness. So people will cite </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=499">this, as I just did, to make a point about the purpose of programs. And it's true. Programs </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=505">should accomplish the goals of their users. But programs are made by people, at least </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=511">for now. And people can accomplish these goals in many different ways. It would be nice if </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=516">there were one and only one obvious way to program. But most often there isn't. Just </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=523">because software does the thing you want it to do, the first rule of normie software, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=527">does not mean it does it in a way that is amenable for time-pressed people like ourselves. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=532">Far better if an equivalent tool has the resources you need to learn what you need to accomplish </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=537">your goals. That's what I mean when I say good software is easy to pick up. Yes, first </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=543">a program should do the thing. But Lord almighty, wouldn't it be nice if I didn't have to struggle </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=548">to learn how to do it with every additional tool? Lower the barrier of accessibility for </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=553">your tools and more people will want to use them. Now, I've been speaking at a high level </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=558">about what normie qualities are and why tools with these qualities make APIs and programming </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=564">cheap. But now I want to show you what I mean. So as an example of the first quality of normie </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=570">software, let's take a look at fast API, which I use to develop the goodies API. To use fast </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=576">API, one need not know the depths of app building or have a degree on state. The maintainers </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=581">of fast API know that ultimately all you want to do is create APIs. To have a means with </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=587">which to deal with requests and responses, this is what I mean when I talk about tools </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=591">doing the thing they do. Fast API is really very good at that. In the app, as you can </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=598">see from the sample code here, all I had to do was to create an endpoint with a decorator </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=603">over my function, get norm conf. In this case, it's a function that returns an ASCII version </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=608">of the norm conf logo that you saw before. It's a get request, so you write get. You </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=613">want a certain path, you write the path. You want to ensure a plain text response, well, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=618">lo and behold, in the body of the function, there is an object that allows you to do that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=623">So yes, I use fast API, built the functions I needed, added the endpoints, and importantly, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=629">I was done in no time. Okay. So from there, I knew I had to create an image, which leads </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=637">me to my next point about normie software being an investment. With the goodies API, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=641">I knew ahead of time that whatever I created, Docker would handle it because it's a tool </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=645">I'm deeply familiar with. This was useful, not only at the micro level of programming, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=650">but at the macro level of optimizing cognitive effort. With good tools, that is tools amenable </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=655">to investment, each use builds upon itself so that your experience of the software is </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=660">a feedback loop that opens up even more use cases. I'm going to keep banging on this drum. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=665">As analysts and data scientists, we are required to know a lot about a lot. If there's a single </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=670">tool that can solve many different problems, that's cognitive load that would have otherwise </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=674">been stratified that is now internalized. That's time I don't have to use picking up </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=679">another tool. That's why I think Docker is normie software. It's something you benefit </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=684">from returning to time and again, as long as it works. With the goodies API, as can </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=691">be seen here, it was a simple thing to import Python 3.10, copy the relevant files, install </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=697">the dependencies, and run a simple uvicorn command. But my point is, it could have been </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=702">any number of things I needed to do and I would have felt just as comfortable because </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=706">my experiences with the software have built upon themselves. This was a time saver. When </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=711">you're choosing your tools at work, try not to reinvent the wheel, as you may lose out </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=715">on current and future productivity. At this point, the image has been made, but it has </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=724">nowhere to go. It has to go somewhere. And that's where GitHub actions come in. If you're </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=728">not aware of GitHub actions, this is a service that allows users to automate their workflows. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=733">That means testing code, building images, sending them where they need to go, all with </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=736">a simple push to your GitHub repository. Pretty nice. Now, because it requires a bunch of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=741">domain knowledge, some might expect me to say that GitHub actions isn't normie software, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=745">that it's not easy to pick up. But to be honest, I think it functions just as I'd want it to. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=750">When software is this configurable, we will be required to learn a thing or two. To me, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=756">being easy to pick up is a function of the amount of effort I have to put in to accomplish </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=761">my goals. And how much support is available to me to quickly solve my problems. If I have </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=767">to dig around in dense documentation, that's a sign of software being too involved, of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=772">not being accessible software. GitHub actions has great documentation. On the subject of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=777">documentation, I actually asked about this the other day in normcom slack. I wanted to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=781">hear other people's thoughts about it, and I got some really great responses from the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=785">community. Basically, my message was about my contention that companies with products </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=789">with broad use cases often have dense, inaccessible documentation. That they're not easy to pick </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=794">up. And among the great responses I got was this one from Sarah Moyer, who unsurprisingly </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=800">writes about this stuff. Her response was like, yeah, these companies have products </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=804">with endless configurability, and therefore write documentation that is super dense and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=809">detailed. But the user often doesn't need that. The user just wants to do the thing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=813">they want to do. They want to pick up the software and run. That was me. For example, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=820">I use poetry for my dependency management. In building the API, I didn't want to have </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=824">to use a different dependency manager when deploying my code from that which I use locally. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=828">So I literally just typed poetry install GitHub actions into Google and found an action and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=834">code examples I needed to build and test with poetry in the goodies CI CD pipeline. This </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=839">was a portion of the result. Almost literally a copy and paste from what I found. It was </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=845">easy to find useful code. The code itself was very self explanatory. I.e., the above </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=849">code doesn't seem very involved to me. Just a bunch of simple YAML. And I got what I needed </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=854">to get done in a short amount of time. It was very easy to pick up. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=859">Altogether, the fast API, Docker, and GitHub action steps of the app development took maybe </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=865">an afternoon to get a working draft done. But I told you at the beginning of the presentation </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=869">that I was going to talk about the mistakes made along the way as an analogy of what we </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=873">go through every day. And mistakes were made. The fact is, once I got to the cloud stage </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=878">of my deployment, I found my productivity slowed significantly. My time started getting </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=884">sucked up in areas I'd rather they hadn't. So how did that happen? Well, let's start </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=889">with a common metaphor about what cloud providers do as I think it will help us discuss some </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=893">of the issues I ran into deploying the app. So far as I can tell, cloud providers are </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=898">kind of like industrial tool manufacturers. They know that their customers will have a </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=902">diverse need for parts and tools. Yes, everyone will need screwdrivers and hammers, but the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=906">size of nails, the kind of materials, the amount of specialization and specification </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=911">that will be needed, that is endless. So they do a bit of everything. And while scale has </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=916">allowed cloud providers to offer many different services, the experience of using these services </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=920">can feel unlike normie software. The problem in the cloud is not simply that it's someone </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=926">else's tools that you're paying to use. It's that it's a warehouse of tools meant to apply </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=930">to almost any situation. And therefore, for the tools are inefficient for your needs as </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=935">they were for mine. So sometimes you just want a screwdriver. But when you go to the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=938">screwdriver section of the warehouse, there are 100 different specifications of screwdrivers. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=943">Also, none of them look like screwdrivers. Also, they're called AWS glue. For example, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=949">I was at the point of deploying the goodies API to ECS, a fully managed container orchestration </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=954">service that felt fully managed by me. Now, the goal here was to host a container so that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=959">everyone can access its endpoints. As a concept, this is a very common need. We build software, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=965">containers are often the manner in which that software ships, and we want people to use </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=968">that software. But it's not that easy. Instead, one needs to become pretty well acquainted </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=974">with things like task definitions, service names and clusters. Even though in my case, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=978">this is an attempt to deploy to Fargate, which is nominally a serverless machine to run on </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=983">to make life easier. To me, this isn't just doing the thing they say they do. As a comparison </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=990">of the possibilities, and I know these are not apples to apples, don't cancel me, but </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=995">in a service like Streamlet cloud, I simply connect a GitHub repo that contains a Docker </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1001">file and my app is deployed. Often very quickly. Again, it's not a one to one comparison, but </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1007">I have a hard time believing it needs to be much more complicated than that. So to me, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1011">this is the first aspect of the project that did not do the thing as it says it does. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1017">Which leads me to the next issue I experienced when deploying the goodies API. So let's say </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1021">I've pushed my app successfully and it's being hosted in ECS. Well, ECS is by definition </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1025">elastic, and its IP address is dynamic. So every time I make a change, a new IP address </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1031">will deploy. But as it is, that's not very useful for norm conf attendees who would like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1035">nothing more than to ping the API to get all its really very important outputs. So what </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1041">do you have to do? Well, you have to connect to route tables, network gateways, subnet, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1045">security groups, and load balancers all in one. Now be sure to work with a DNS in route </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1050">53 right away. That comes after the load balancer. And for good measure, if you want it to be </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1054">a secure HTTPS API, you're going to have to set up secure port forwarding on 443, which </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1059">requires listeners and target groups. And well, it just gets tiring to list out. Especially </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1064">because this wasn't even what I was supposed to be working on. Now, even if you have a </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1068">general understanding of all these things like me, you can still get tripped up by the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1071">ordering of these operations or even more frustrating, which I am permissions you need </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1075">to set up. The issue is, as I've said, we have been given a warehouse full of tools </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1080">and told to go make a house where usually you have plumbers and electricians and more. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1086">We often have to be all those things at once. We didn't always have to be network engineers </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1090">in addition to everything else, but to deploy an API in big cloud services, oftentimes now </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1096">we do. And if you expect us to know all these things, that's fine. But it's necessarily </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1102">a trade off from some other work that we could be working on. It's costly. Ideally, we shouldn't </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1108">have to be doing all of this. We could be working on the things that really matter, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1112">like debating the usefulness of automatic code formatters or which IDE to use. But the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1117">way it is right now, I think that there should be an easier way. And so here I would argue </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1121">that work on things like networking is not an investment. I'm not benefiting from working </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1125">on these tools because they're not helping me achieve my core functionality. They can </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1129">be abstracted away and I would not lose much. That's why I think this network engineering </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1134">was not a useful software investment for me. Okay, so finally, let's talk about things </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1139">more generally. To get through all the API deployment from ECS and Route 53 to load balancing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1144">and more, we need to rely on documentation. The problem is, well, as Vicky says here, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1150">cloud documentation can be pretty rough. And as we've established, the more complicated </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1154">the system, the more it can do. The denser the cloud documentation typically is. But </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1160">when you're faced with all the documentation, you're often left trying to parse through </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1163">it for your relevant use case. And if there are a few examples with sample code, it can </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1168">get rough. That's why I'd argue when working a lot with cloud software, including what </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1172">it took to deploy the goodies API, it's more involved than it needs to be. Even simply </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1178">just by trying to find the relevant information you need to work to accomplish your use case. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1183">This is why this too broke a rule of normie software. It is not easy to pick up and it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1189">could be easier. Which brings me to where we started. Remember the original diagram </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1194">I had with my ideal setup? Well, on the left is that diagram. And on the right is actually </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1201">a relatively simplified version of where I ended up. It's a bunch scrunched in there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1206">So let me summarize. While making the actual app stayed the same, the actual deployment </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1210">to the cloud was far less normie than I wanted. So where does that leave us? I started this </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1215">talk by saying that I wanted to build a cheap API for the conference. And in some ways I </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1220">did. Over two months, we've paid maybe like $30 for a scalable production grade API. But </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1225">in other ways, the API was costly. Costly on my time. True, some of the tools I reached </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1230">for were beneficial to me. I argue that's because those tools had traits of normie software. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1235">They do the things they say they do. They were investments. They're easy to pick up. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1239">But once I reached the deployment to the cloud, my experience left something to be desired. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1243">It was too much work on things that distract from the core features of what I think we </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1246">should be doing. So you may be thinking, okay, well, then the solution is to pick a service </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1251">that specializes in hosting and deployment, Ben. And that may or may not be true. But </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1256">what I'm really trying to get at here is that if I had taken the time to think about the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1260">tradeoffs of my software choices, I would have had other time for a thousand other things </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1265">I'd like to be doing with my time. And in our jobs, it's the same thing. We're often </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1269">jumping from task to task. Especially if you're at an early stage startup like me. Instead </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1275">of grabbing the shiny software, it behooves us to take a moment and consider which of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1279">our screwdrivers to use. Especially because if it has to do with cloud, it will often </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1284">take longer than it probably could. So my final message at the end of all of this is </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1289">seek out Normie software. Tools that you're familiar with are good. But even if you're </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1293">comfortable with the cloud like me, recognize the scale of the problem you're trying to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1296">solve. Don't use a chainsaw when scissors will do. And more generally, our time is precious. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1302">We are asked to do so much from ourselves and our jobs. Do yourself a favor. Choose </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1308">your software carefully and respect your time both now and in the future. Now, some of you, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1314">I know we're hoping I literally walk through the instructions to deploy the app to the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1317">cloud, but I thought that would be too boring to regurgitate. So I wrote a post. It's on </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1321">that QR code. You can check my website. But for everyone else, I've appreciated your time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1326">Thank you so much. This conference has been amazing. And it's been a great, I'm really </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRGxjfLVrTA&t=1329">grateful for the opportunity to speak with you today. </a>
