        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=0">My name is Helena Seren. I live in New Jersey. I'm a ceramic artist and I live with my rescue </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=10">dog, Cumin, my three GPUs, and my husband. And today I'll be talking about game of construction. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=19">Construction is a metaphor for art making by Pollock and he famously said, it is all </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=27">a game of construction. Some with a brush, some with a shovel, some chose a pen, and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=33">some of us choose neural networks to do our art. But the first question, what makes me </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=40">a ceramic artist now qualified for talking at a male conference? I will say that recently, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=49">not recently, a couple of years ago, I discovered this magical word, Kugei. And it means craft </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=58">in Japanese, but literally it means engineered art. And since then I'm calling myself engineering </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=66">artist. And as a Kugei practitioner, it was my whole life when I was coding the low level </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=74">protocols in telecom, when I kind of expanded into machine learning seven years ago, and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=83">when I'm now a practicing artist making art for a living for the last almost four years. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=92">So Kugei is our word here. So, and I'll be talking about creating art, making art in </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=99">the intersection of art and technology. So technology is our tool for us engineering </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=106">artists. And it's not only with AI, it's basically for the last maybe century, it's even accelerated </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=115">where technical invention brought the new art form. So we can pinpoint this in like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=122">history of art is like prints, then photography, cinema, computer arts, and now AI kind of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=133">like burst into the scene big time. So I work with generative adversarial networks. I mean, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=142">up until prompt-based AI came into the picture, I would say like AI interchangeably with GANs. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=150">Now I need to qualify that I work with GANs mostly. So the base recipe, I work, first </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=156">of all, I work with my own data sets. I collect them. I make photography or I use my digitized </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=164">sketches. So here is like my famous vegan model, which I took like salad leaves at the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=172">beginning of COVID basically sitting at home in lockdown. So I took, like I made two salad </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=180">leaves, 2000 pictures of lettuce in like on my force for two days, making pictures in </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=187">the light box of few boxes of whole food, organic, clean lettuce leaves. And I trained </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=199">the network StyleGAN and it started after like few days of training, it started generating </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=208">this, creating this generative produce, what I started calling after that, like Entusys. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=216">So this talk, I'm quoting a lot of, is a culture trash and I'm like always into quoting. And </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=226">I think this quote by Carpate is really kind of like relevant for artist engineers who </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=234">like team caring. So basically training your network is you sitting through the like days </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=243">and nights watching your model kind of making stuff, saving checkpoints. And the difference </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=251">may be with like researchers or scientists who work with neural networks. My loss functions </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=261">are more kind of like wandering functions. I mean, I don't kind of care for particular </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=267">loss. I care more about visuals and that's why I'm glued to the screen because I need </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=274">to see like particular checkpoints where I kind of discover some gem. And I used to call </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=283">training networks is my meditative regime, breathing in and out with the loss function. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=290">So but basically it's like a game of curation. I mean, a lot of this and for practitioners </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=299">being them engineers or artists is just like you curating your results. And that's why </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=305">I have this famous Burrows quote because you need, I mean, in any art form, you kind of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=314">like do sketches, you do a lot of curation. It's not kind of like particular to making </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=320">art with the eye. But also I think it's like a great tool of honing your visual perception. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=327">I mean, I kind of like some of my early work is a cringe, but some of them is sort of like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=334">you know, looking at the world like a child and spoiled and in awe of what you see. And </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=342">this is one of my basically one of my first publicly shared pieces, which I'm still very </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=350">proud about. So game of subversion. I keep saying that, like, in a sense, us working </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=359">with the same networks that researchers work, it's a little bit kind of like subverting </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=366">what the model do. Because if researchers, their goal at large, getting to some digital </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=375">correctness, in my case, is more like seeing interesting and novel and exciting stuff. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=383">So that's why maybe nobody cares about like first cycles of training. But for me, and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=389">this is a picture on the left, the fleeting beauty of early iterations. But also like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=396">when you get to like beyond the expiration date, I mean, I have some models on the right </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=402">you see the example of model drop, of mode drop, where I trained basically the network </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=409">for almost like two years on and off. Yeah, and this is the network that was trained on </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=415">my sketches. But also one of the technique I used a lot after I kind of like passed this </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=422">excitement of like something in something out, I started building the pipelines. So </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=428">kind of like one of the example of like poor woman super resolution where I sort of like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=435">trained the next network or the result of the previous one, just getting to the resolution </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=443">which I wanted or needed because like the initial result was like 256 by 256. So I love </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=453">this quote by Carpati, who said, it is not a single model, it's a beautiful composition </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=459">of many sub models. That's how my pipelines look because I have like about 100 models </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=465">that I use practically all the time. Another thing that happens is like you make art in </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=476">on the limitations of your medium. So early on, like again, to overcome this problem of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=483">low resolution, I started working with the grid. And for me, it became like a neural </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=488">aesthetics in a sense. So I could have like interesting images and augment them or kind </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=495">of like make them bigger by employing the grid approach. And then I was surprised where </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=503">like famous artist Jack Whitten called this the grid is a DNA of visual perception. It's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=510">an amazing quote. I didn't think in this terms, but that's what it is. Another thing like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=516">again, like playing this subversion game, people who worked with neural networks early </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=524">on remember this like problem of checkerboard. So kind of I jokingly started calling this </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=530">checkerboard amplification series. So it's kind of like post-genism. I started writing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=536">a lot of like Python scripts, just doing like this computational grids playing with a few </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=544">kind of like digital collaging and stuff. So that's how this series of non-pintilism </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=550">and checkerboard amplification series were born. Another thing like for a couple of years, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=557">I worked with my sketches and it's resulted in this, what I call carvings of Latinsco, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=564">riffing on the Lascaux caves where like caveman's like our predecessors in a sense drew on the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=577">cave. So I think like we early AI practitioners drew our part on this Latinsco caves. But </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=586">also I like this quote by Linda Berry who said like take advantage of basic human inclination </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=593">to find meaning in random information. So basically the semi abstract output of the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=602">early models invited this kind of like planning and gameplay. And I worked with it a lot. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=610">I mean, I kind of like, it's sort of like honing your verbal perception or your kind </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=617">of like pun mechanism. This is kind of like controversial, but for me it's very important. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=626">I kind of like burnt a lot on this. So when like almost everybody, I started with AWS </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=635">of course, but then when I like five, six years ago started training on my own art, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=641">I decided I need my own setup. Not only because I didn't want to move like my data all the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=649">time back and forth and forgetting to disconnect the volumes. I decided I basically want my </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=657">own rig. And I started with the GTX, GeForce like 1060, I think. And then kind of people </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=667">of Nvidia gifted me with this quadro. And like I say, GPU is a girl best friend, of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=676">course. So now I have like this small stable of GPUs. And like, since I sort of like make </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=684">this phrase in the different applied arts, I last year I kind of got my own kiln and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=692">I have like other kinds of stuff. And it's not about bragging. I mean, it's like printing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=698">I used to print a lot and like outsourcing, it's a pain and you pay dear because first </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=704">of all, in quality, because you can't control this. And another kind of like you pay money </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=709">for food to people which you can kind of like not pay and make your art more affordable </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=716">in a sense. So this was my star slide in every talks for the last like three years. And it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=726">sort of became obsolete with like prompt models and I'll explain why. So in a nutshell, what </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=734">I was talking about here and it was relevant when like for training on your own data. So </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=740">the more you own and the more you curate your data, the more original you are. So like in </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=748">the origin of this chart, you have the less original art. So it's like art breather and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=756">first kind of like public trained applications. But then like prompt text to image applications </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=768">came into for this year and we all basically gathered around this push the button thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=776">And this is like I thought I looked at this slide and thought like maybe it's not relevant </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=782">anymore. And then I think this Z-axis with ideas and I think like since when you can </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=793">find them, they join them. So we are all in the realms of this prompt models. I mean, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=801">it's inevitable and this is something the reality that we can't deny. So I think it's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=805">still kind of like relevant graph, but with more access, how ideas become more and more </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=812">important. So that's probably again, I mean, something that take away from here. So to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=823">finish this part is just how I see this AI artist or basically any artist who works with </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=832">like technology. So you're basically curiosity driven. I mean, it's like the world of what </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=840">ifs you try this. I mean, what if I kind of like make this data set or this data set? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=846">You improvise on the spot. You see your model behave this way. You kind of like encourage </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=853">it to do it or kind of like do something else. You are very attentive and good listener because </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=860">I think like patience is a very important trait for working with technology. You need </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=866">to be attuned to what you do, but you also need to like tinkering. It's a lot of tinkering </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=873">when you write your code, whatever like AI or any other thing. So creative coder goes </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=879">without saying. You make your own tools. I mean, the less applications you use, the more </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=887">interesting you are. It's not guaranteed, but still kind of like a precursor. So collector </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=892">process oriented, we already talked about this meditative qualities of AI training. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=899">Collector, I mean, I basically save everything. I mean, you never know. I mean, whatever, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=905">checkpoints, like outputs, you never know what you can use. I used to kind of like pre-curate </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=913">them. Then I stopped doing it because something that looked like a junk two years ago, all </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=919">of a sudden becomes trash right now. So you never know your perception changes, the tools </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=925">you're working with changes. So a lot of like dynamics. Also easily excited and easily bored. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=934">I mean, because we work with novelty tools, you move around a lot. So you get excited, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=941">you try it. I mean, you maybe need to stay with certain kind of like stuff for a while </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=947">to see. So you're not jumping from thing to thing like without giving it a chance to express </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=954">itself. And also I think it's very important not to be precious about your work. And of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=961">course, having a good sense of humor helps. I mean, because it kind of like helps with </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=966">the frustration, but also kind of like because AI is still kind of goofy often. So in the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=974">next like five minutes that left, I'll talk about projects that I worked at. And I mean, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=982">neural bricolage manifest, like I keep asking, getting this question, what bricolage means. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=989">And neural is kind of like comes from neural networks, but bricolage is basically making </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=997">useful and beautiful out of heap of latent space. I mean, this is how I kind of like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1004">riff on the definition. And my art is for people. So again, like artists, some artists </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1013">say, oh, I will create because it's like I create for myself. There is a part of this, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1019">but they make stuff for people. Without people, I would be just curl in the armchair and just </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1026">reading stuff. So a little bit of like, this is like mandatory milestone line. And how </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1037">I call myself like taking this expression from my friend. So I basically awkwardly stuck </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1044">between digital and analog. In fact, I was very surprised when somebody like three years </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1049">ago called me a digital artist. I never consider myself being it. Digital was always means </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1055">to an end and then being like projects I discuss right now. So I mean, I try to kind of like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1062">do interesting stuff, different stuff with the output. So I went through the period of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1070">printmaking, silkscreen, cyanotype. Then I started making the artist books because it's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1078">so kind of like I love books and I think it's like everybody needs to make at least like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1083">one book in their lives. So the first book was like a religious trope on like this Genesis </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1092">play. And it was like small, all my books are self-published. So this was like my first </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1099">books with the latent doodles. Then I think it's very important to have like collaborations </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1106">with like artists. I'm very independent, but still I believe like when you find the great </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1113">collaborator is just like amazing. So in this case, Dmitry Chernyak, a generative artist </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1121">created for me the training data sets with 3GS. And then I trained like 17 models total </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1130">and so like from scratch. And that's like on the right, the results that we are publishing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1135">the book is coming up soon. So another kind of collaboration is the book of vegan was </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1143">just published with the amazing food writer, Kate Ray, who wrote recipes for this book. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1149">I'm very proud. I designed this book from scratch. It's like I went overboard. It's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1155">150 pages thick, but still this is what it is. And like we discussed, I'm in the pottery </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1164">for this year. And my first foray with generative pottery was like a couple of years ago. And </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1173">I liked this like riff on pottery baron, which became pottery again. And yeah, I mean, then </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1182">I kind of like stumble on a learning curve because it's a slow process. I'm kind of like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1189">all over the place person. So ceramics was not that, I mean, it was tough. But again, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1198">COVID and stuff sort of slowed me down. And I think like this time I'm ready. And basically </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1207">I have my first fruits of my kiln coming out. And again, in a nutshell, it's something that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1215">I use again outputs to kind of like go through the convoluted process of printing 3D, you </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1227">know, molds, then pressing or slip casting. So it's like very involved process. And maybe </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1235">it's such a difference from like fast paced TIR that I really kind of like getting very </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6FUXTDNKKQ&t=1244">used to it. And I love this. But to finish it is all a game of construction. Thank you. </a>
