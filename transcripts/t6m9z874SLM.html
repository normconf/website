        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=0">I'm the chief scientist at Motif Analytics, and I'm going to tell a story about something </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=6">that we've been working on and basically my like ex post rationalization for why what </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=12">we did made sense. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=14">And I hope it sort of portrays like a lesson that I've learned and that like actually what </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=18">we're doing does make sense, but maybe it doesn't and maybe I'm just making up some </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=21">excuses. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=22">So this is a David Byrne quote that I've adapted. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=26">I joined Motif in July, we started working on sequence analytics, and I found myself </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=30">at this beautiful startup with all these smart people and we wrote a query language. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=34">And that's what we've been working on for the last few months and I'm not ready to show </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=37">it to you today. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=38">And this isn't going to be a Motif commercial as much as I would love to do that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=43">But it is a little bit questionable, like should you write a query language and everyone </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=47">loves SQL. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=48">And I know a lot of people don't like new query languages. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=51">This is somebody that I really respect a lot, Eric Bernardson, saying I don't really like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=55">software that invents its own query language. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=57">We would joke at the company that like maybe our product is dead on arrival because no </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=62">one's going to want to learn a new thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=63">And smart kids say no to DSLs. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=65">Which is like, I just love this graphic that he included. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=70">And you know, like once you decide to go down this road, every time you make a bad choice </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=75">becomes harder to make a good one. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=77">And so you can end up in a bad state if you make a bad choice at the very beginning of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=80">your project. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=81">And so new query language may be a terrible idea. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=84">I'm going to try to justify to you why we might need that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=88">And then like how why you also might need to be thinking about different kinds of query </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=92">languages. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=93">So here's the setup for Motif. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=95">And I'm not going to belabor it too much. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=97">But roughly we think about user behavior on a website or an app as a sequence of events </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=103">that occur that have a user ID, a timestamp, an event name, possibly some other metadata. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=108">And the kinds of questions that we like to ask are what happens after a user does something? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=112">What happens before something happens to a user? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=114">And then what happens between? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=116">These are what we call like sequential questions. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=118">They have a certain flavor to them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=121">And so we can lay this out left to right on a timeline and say, OK, this is the kind of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=126">golden path for a user of a video streaming service. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=128">So they started a search page. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=131">They see some search results. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=132">They click on that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=133">They preview the video, start watching, and finish watching. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=137">And a very natural set of questions to ask are things like, how many users make it through </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=141">this process? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=143">Are they getting stuck at various times? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=145">And where do they get stuck? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=146">And where do they stop using your site? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=149">Do they take detours into doing something else that isn't on this happy path? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=154">And does it depend on things that happened earlier in the sequence of various ways, like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=158">say maybe what device they're using or what kind of connection that they're on? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=163">And is it something that we could possibly fix? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=165">And so this is a space of questions that's really rich and important for people. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=169">And I think we all are kind of interested in answering questions like these in our jobs </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=173">often. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=174">One person in particular, T.H. Murphy, who's a friend, and he gave me permission to share </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=179">some of his slides from his Snowflake talk, spent a long time thinking about this and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=183">working on it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=184">So he has this talk, Funnel Analysis and SQL from Start to Finish. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=188">And I didn't actually get to see the talk in person, so I can't claim it was a great </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=191">talk. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=192">I'm sure it was. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=193">But the slides are great, and they're very informative. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=195">He basically spent a long time prototyping three ideas, and then there's a fourth one </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=200">that I won't include because it's inconvenient for my point. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=204">But he's got three approaches to solving this problem using SQL. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=207">And so the idea is we want to count how many users make it from A to B to C to D, possibly </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=213">with time gaps in between that we want to constrain, and that we want to kind of figure </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=218">out how to analyze this funnel. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=221">And there's three approaches to it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=222">There's a join approach, a window function approach, and a regular expressions approach. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=227">And they have different characteristics, like max k is one of them, which is like this is </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=232">how many steps that you're actually capable of counting in a reasonable amount of time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=236">And so we can see for join, it's like a small number. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=238">Then there's performance, which is like how much data we're able to process. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=242">And then very importantly, there's this column on ease of use, and Tej very conveniently has </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=246">this star rating system. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=247">I don't know if it's like out of five stars or out of three. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=251">And perhaps he said this in the talk, but this is kind of roughly what we think about </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=254">a lot as analysts, is like how do we solve a problem in SQL? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=258">And then what kind of characteristics will that solution have? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=261">So you can think about like, what are we trying to do when we do sequence analytics in SQL? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=264">And why might this be a little bit challenging to think about how to do? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=267">Well, the left join approach is like taking a table and doing joins onto the same table. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=272">And you could even do like a recursive join if you wanted to, and create like a bunch </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=276">of columns for all the different sequence elements. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=280">And this is what Edgar Codd, the inventor of the relational model, would want you to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=284">do because he doesn't want you to add window functions or denormalize your data in any </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=288">way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=289">But this is very not performant because you have to do joins. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=291">And for some reason, databases are bad at doing many joins, despite that that's what </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=297">they're designed for. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=298">You could also use window functions. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=300">So the predicate now would, instead of being across columns like in these purple boxes, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=304">it would be across rows. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=306">And this is really kind of getting at the heart of what we're trying to do here is like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=309">apply conditions or predicates that span multiple rows in the data or multiple relations. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=314">And so we partition, order the data, and then we can do this window function approach. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=318">Or we could denormalize the data and create a special column that has an aggregate type. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=324">And then that aggregate type, we could write like UDFs or something like that to apply </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=327">to that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=328">And in Tiege's approach, it's like, oh, we'll just use regular expressions. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=331">We'll construct strings and use regular expressions. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=333">And that's another kind of like way that we might think about solving this problem. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=338">At the end of his approach, he sort of like motivates these things plus a fourth approach. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=343">And then like several months later, I saw him tweet this last night. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=347">This is like shows how late I was working on my slides. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=349">I never want to write a funnel in SQL ever again. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=352">So this is the person that I know who spent the most time working on funnels in SQL. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=356">Maybe it's because he spent so much time on it, but he knows the most about how to do </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=360">it and how it could be done. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=361">And he doesn't think it's particularly fun to do or usable. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=365">I think they want to get to the point here of like, just because something is possible </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=370">to do in a query language or in any language for that matter, it doesn't mean that it's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=374">likely that people will do it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=376">And this is an important point. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=377">It's just not about like whether something is capable of doing something. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=382">It's about whether a user would practically do something. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=384">And we have Tiege Murphy, the expert on funnel analysis, telling us that he never wants to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=389">do it again. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=390">It's a bad sign for whether people will be doing funnel analysis in their jobs. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=395">I want to make the point that it's not the relational model that's the problem here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=399">It's a fully expressive model. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=400">I mean, like, you know, Edgar Codd is right. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=402">Like relational model can solve this problem. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=405">And the events are perfectly well represented as a relation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=409">So it's very reasonable to think about like, why should SQL not be capable of doing this </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=414">very easily? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=416">And like, why should what should we be doing instead? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=419">And another important point to make here is that this is an analysis we're not going to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=422">probably write one time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=423">There's this illusion that like, oh, we write this query and walk away from it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=426">But actually, we all know that when we write a query that we end up tweaking it and making </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=430">changes and that the funnel might change or be more complicated than we first, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=434">first acknowledge and that this is an iterative process. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=437">And so we're going to need to solve this in maybe a different way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=439">And I want to be open minded about that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=441">And that's where that foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=444">So like, this is the only tool I'm allowed to use is the one that I already have is a </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=447">little bit of a foolish consistency. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=451">So we have three possible things that we really want to boxes that we want to tick. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=455">We want to have completeness, which means like any possible funnel question could be </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=459">answered. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=460">And it might be, it might be possible that some things are not possible in SQL, I don't </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=464">want to make that claim, because I know someone will immediately rebut it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=468">So I'm not going to say that there's a there's a thing that you can't do in SQL, unless I </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=472">want someone to actually solve that problem. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=475">But I do think that expressiveness is a really important criterion here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=478">It's like, even if it were possible to do an analysis, do I need an expert to do it? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=482">Could I do it in a reasonable amount of time? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=485">And then there's this like efficiency question, which Tej is very concerned with is like, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=488">could it be done quickly or at all on the large amount of data that we might have? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=493">So we want to kind of like, tick these three boxes if we can. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=497">So let's think like abstractly about what are we really trying to do when we design </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=501">this procedure is like we have input data, and then our job is to fill this hole, the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=506">dashed line here and create some output data that is the answer to our question. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=510">So break this down into three phases. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=511">There's this expressing phase, where I go from intention to query syntax, and you can </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=516">see all the joins that I have to do to get it to work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=519">And then the database system will execute that query, produce a result, and then I will </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=523">look at the feedback and like verify that it is complete. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=526">And so you can see like all three steps together, we get a core loop for an analyst who's working </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=531">through a problem. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=532">I have an intention. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=533">It's like, this is what I want. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=535">This is the question that I'm answering. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=536">I want to answer. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=537">I have my human time that I spent getting to syntax. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=540">I have machine time getting from syntax to result. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=542">And then I have human time sort of spending time on the result and verifying that it's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=546">the right thing that I want. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=548">And getting through this loop quickly is really the name of the game for analytics productivity. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=553">And if we could do this quickly, then we could solve a lot of problems. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=556">A lot of people will say, hey, the machine time actually does matter. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=559">And I think that often we're just playing in different areas of this two dimensional </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=564">space of how often we spend writing new queries versus how often we spend executing new queries. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=569">And I think a lot of people will think about, oh, like the query needs to be efficient. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=572">So it must be written in SQL. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=573">Well, that's people who want to work in the upper left hand quadrant where they want a </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=577">mature data pipeline where it's very repeatable and reliable. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=581">I am very interested in this bottom right hand quadrant where we're interactively working </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=585">with data and reframing our questions on a regular basis in order to get the answer that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=589">we really want and verify that it's correct. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=592">And there might be two paths up into this like holy grail top quadrant where you're </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=596">doing a lot of interactive work and also very fast on the machine time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=600">And I think it's plausible that we'd start from interactive analytics and figure out </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=604">how to scale something from there rather than start with a really mature thing that answers </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=608">one question well and expand the scope of it, say, using something like templates. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=613">All right. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=615">So I got a little recap where there's the ProSQL side. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=618">I'm not even going to make the argument because everyone's already made it online and told </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=622">me not to even give this talk. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=623">SQL is great. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=624">It's fast and scalable. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=626">The data I have are already easily queryable. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=628">And of course, everyone can already read and fix my SQL queries, which I don't think that's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=633">actually true. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=634">You can see it's an anti-SQL point too. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=636">And also, people have figured out how to analyze funnels in SQL. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=639">So it's not impossible, but it's an awkward fit and human time is important. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=645">And key to my point here is that if it takes a long time, we might not ever even do it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=649">And there'll be questions that are left unanswered that are important for our business. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=652">And so just because something can be solved in SQL doesn't mean it's important to our </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=656">business. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=657">And some things that are hard to solve in SQL might actually be very difficult, but </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=660">it might actually be very important for what we need to learn. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=664">Okay. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=665">So next phase of the talk is how to not use SQL. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=671">And actually, I changed the name of the slide at the last minute to how to use not SQL because </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=678">I don't think it's about replacing SQL whole hog. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=681">I don't really ever want to claim that I'm going to invent a new query language that's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=685">better than SQL in all ways. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=688">There's no free lunch, but we need to think about building systems that are complimentary </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=692">to the expressive power of SQL in other ways. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=695">And that it will be a thing that extends our superpowers and gives us like ability to answer </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=699">new questions, but can compose well with the SQL queries that we're already writing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=706">So here's my rough diagram of an analytics data, like a whole data work and the end from </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=712">the raw data all the way to the things that users really care about. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=716">I know a lot of people online will probably quibble about all the boxes and arrows here, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=720">but just all models are wrong. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=723">This one serves my purpose. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=725">And okay. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=726">So we've got the stuff on the very far right. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=728">This is the impact that we're having from the data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=732">And then we have the raw data all the way on the left. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=733">And any analysis that we do, anything that builds value as a path along this graph in </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=738">some ways, including possibly loops where we do something more than once. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=742">So if we could think about different roles here, like here's an ML engineer who queries </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=746">relational data with Python and then trains a model and then serves the model and the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=751">model drives impact by powering some beautiful new feature. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=756">We got the business analyst who queries the relational data that's already been turned </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=760">into an OLAP cube with a BI tool, creates a plot and convinces the CEO that they're </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=765">going to do a bad course of action. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=768">Or the data engineer who is thinking about how are we going to extract the load, the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=772">raw data and get it into relational data? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=773">And how are we going to run the pipelines, which are a batch of SQL queries that we're </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=777">going to run on the relational data and continue to write new relational data into the relational </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=781">data store. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=784">So everyone sort of has a place in this graph and it's usually like a path through it that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=788">you are responsible for and that you think about. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=792">But the heart of the graph is the relational data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=796">It's like, this is the heart of our organization. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=798">And I used to study social networks, we call this a brokerage position of brokerage and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=802">social networks. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=803">It means that to solve any problem, to communicate between any two nodes in this graph, it's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=806">very likely that you're going to have to go through the relational data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=810">And so this is an important kind of like design consideration when you're building a new thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=814">It's like if it doesn't read from and write to relational data, then it might be dead </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=818">on arrival, like the query language that we built. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=823">So this is the inner loop, is a set of functions that we're going to run that consume relational </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=829">data and emit relational data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=831">And typically this is done with SQL or with Python and R in my experience, maybe less </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=835">often. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=836">SQL is the most common case. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=838">Python and R can do this too. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=839">You can read from it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=840">There's lots of connectors for databases and then you can write back to the database, very </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=844">common pattern at both of the companies that I work for, Lyft and Facebook. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=849">And one way that I like to think about this is that there's this abstract space of relational </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=854">data and each of these operations that we're doing, it's like a path that we're creating </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=858">between two points where the starting point is the data that we have and the end point </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=863">is the data that we'd like to have, which is like the answer to the question. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=866">And so by looping through this loop many, many times, we construct a path that gets </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=871">us to the data that we want. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=872">So a chain of these operations is a solution to the problem that we're trying to solve </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=876">when we're doing analytics tasks. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=879">So how can we add a new functionality? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=881">How can we be more expressive than SQL? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=883">We need to remove the SQL node and replace it with something else. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=887">And so here are three broad strategies that I've seen in practice for doing this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=892">And so the first one is kind of like the one that I already talked about, which is like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=895">taking the data, putting it in R or Python, working with it in pandas or dplyr, which </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=899">know how to deal with relational data and can then like emit relational data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=903">So this sort of like substitutes out a SQL execution environment for something else, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=907">but it still conforms to the interface that we care about. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=911">Then there's this like new breed of thing that I'm seeing, which is like to transpile </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=914">a language into SQL. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=917">So Malloy does this and prequel does this, which is like, take, take a query that is </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=921">easier to write in some language and make it into a SQL query that could be like a big </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=926">ginormous thing that we're really worried about whether it's going to work, but it will </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=930">because it's a transpiler and it can guarantee correctness. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=933">This is also an attractive strategy because you can add this for expressivity, but get </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=937">all the benefits of using SQL under the hood and using the same execution environment. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=942">And then what I'm going to talk about is actually this, like convert it into a new space and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=947">then operate it within the new space and then convert it back into relational data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=950">So we need two things is the box is a noun. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=953">It's a useful representation for the data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=955">That's not relational data, a converter to and from that thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=959">And then some expressive set of operations that work within that space. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=964">So here's my topological analysis of this is that we have relational data space on the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=972">left-hand side, and we have some alternative representation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=975">And so this is how we do this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=976">We have a round trip that we're going to take this difficult or expensive transformation </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=981">that we'd like to make in space X, but that we can actually do in space Y under some sort </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=986">of operations that we actually understand and are debuggable and easy to express. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=990">And then we're going to round trip it back using the converter. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=994">So this doesn't sound like a crazy idea. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=996">Actually I think I've seen this play out in practice in kind of informal ways. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=999">And there's at least four different kinds of intermediate representations that I think </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1003">make sense here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1004">One is graphs. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1005">Graphs are sort of very hard to query in SQL, especially along paths. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1009">But if you convert something to a graph, it's very easy to think about how to solve graph </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1012">query problems in some other way, say with a language like Cypher. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1016">And then you could convert a graph back to SQL quite easily because they're very easy </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1019">to map back and forth. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1021">I see people using embeddings where you take individual rows or items within a SQL table </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1026">and convert them into vector representation and then work with vectors. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1030">And then we could generalize vectors into some kind of tensor and work with tensors. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1035">And tensor operations are very easy to do on, say, GPUs or in some area where you have </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1041">a better ability to execute the computation in a more efficient way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1045">And tensors are very easy to map back and forth into the relational model. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1049">And then finally you have the heart and soul of Motif is moving it into a sequence representation, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1055">operating on sequences directly, and then moving sequences back into the relational </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1059">model when they need to be analyzed in a different way. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1063">And if this all sounds really crazy to you, I want to just call out almost everybody who's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1068">watching this talk has done this mapping at some point in their lives. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1072">They have exported a CSV file from a database, worked with it in Excel, and uploaded it back </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1078">into the database. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1079">You're using the design pattern that I'm proposing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1081">If you've done this, and I bet if I asked, if there were a real audience here and you </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1084">could all raise your hands, a lot of people would be raising them right now. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1088">This is the OG way of mapping something into a space where it's more malleable, the operations </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1093">are easier to think about, and that you can be more productive. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1097">And think about what is the problem with this workflow? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1099">It's not Excel. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1101">It's that exporting CSVs and importing CSVs is a lossy converter. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1104">And if you had like lossless conversion, that actually this design pattern would be much </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1108">more resilient than it really is in practice. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1112">I have one minute to wrap up. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1113">I just want to make the claim here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1115">I love SQL. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1116">I'm not trying to tell you not to use it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1117">I'm just saying that sometimes you may be considered not using it when things are hard </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1122">to do in SQL. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1124">And it comes from this kind of willingness to admit that you're going to iterate on solving </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1128">a problem. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1129">I don't think that we write queries one time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1131">They're usually like a malleable artifact that we're trying to nudge into the right </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1135">state and that we iterate as our business changes. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1137">And so expressive code and things that are able to express operations in a succinct way </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1142">are very valuable, both for writing and for reading and understanding and reasoning about </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1146">your system behavior. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1147">And so this expressiveness really matters. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1150">And choosing a good representation will actually make expressing the problem that you want </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1154">to solve, the solution to the problem that you want to solve a lot easier. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1158">And this and the way to integrate it with the way that we currently work is to think </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1161">really hard about the interfaces. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1163">Don't reinvent nouns, reinvent verbs. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1166">And you can you can add one new noun if you want. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1168">But then at that point, you need to think only about verbs. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1170">And this has been a very productive way for me to think about the problem. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1173">I've seen this design pattern in other places, like say in the tidyverse where, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1178">the type of data frame that we use has expanded in scope over time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1182">So I just want to kind of like encourage everybody to be a polyglot and think about new verbs. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1187">They can change the way you think about problems. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1189">And you might find that it's more productive and that you can still use SQL. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1193">It's always going to be there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1194">All right. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6m9z874SLM&t=1195">Thanks, everybody. </a>
