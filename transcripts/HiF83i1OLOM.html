        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=0">don't do invisible work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=2">I would actually say that probably the lesson </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=5">to take away from this is that the most normie thing ever </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=8">is to like fight for your work </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=10">and to not do work that people don't see </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=12">and to get credit for your work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=15">So we will go through </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=17">and you'll see a lot of the similar themes. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=19">So hi, I'm Chris. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=21">I don't know how to screen share apparently, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=23">but I do work at a somewhat popular website. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=26">I also am a manager and I've been a manager for a long time </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=31">and I've also had managers. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=33">In fact, one of my managers is actually in this Slack. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=37">Grant is in here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=38">So if you ever wanna know like just like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=41">why my life is terrible, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=42">just point to Grant and then just rag him right now. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=45">I can't actually see the Slack, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=47">but definitely just point to Grant. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=50">So let's do a little visualization. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=53">This is a representation of all the work </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=57">that you as a diligent employee </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=60">of Acme software did in a month. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=65">Let's say this was like some big project </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=68">that the CEO wanted you to do, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=70">And so it took five units of whatever. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=73">This is this recurring work that you do every week </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=76">where you standardize code </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=78">or debug something or something. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=81">And then here is one ad hoc thing off to the side </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=84">because someone from some department </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=86">you've never heard of before comes to you </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=87">and wants some kind of analysis. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=90">The problem is that if you don't consciously spend the time </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=96">to track your work, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=97">this is what you actually remember what you did </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=100">and like a week later. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=102">And everyone knows this feeling, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=104">It is so hard to write about what you did the week before </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=107">if you wait until Monday. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=108">And if we keep going with the same pattern, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=112">this is what you remember a month later. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=116">And if you go even farther, take one step away, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=119">this is what your boss remembers, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=121">all the things you did, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=123">For a month later. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=124">This is what your boss remembers a year later. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=128">And everything else in there, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=130">if it's not tracked in some way, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=132">like if there's not a way to jog your memory that you did it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=135">and very specifically to jog your boss's memory </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=137">that you did it, it is as if it is invisible work, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=142">It means that you don't get credit for doing those things, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=146">even though as we've established, if we go back, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=148">like you did all this super cool stuff, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=150">You worked on this big project, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=151">you did this recurring debugging thing, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=153">you talked to this like special person off to the side </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=155">and helped them out with the project. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=157">And yet you don't get any credit for it from your boss </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=160">if no one remembers that it happens. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=162">And the thing that I would like to point out </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=165">and the thing that I hope you take away </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=167">from this presentation is that it happens all the time, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=171">all the time in tech, all over the place. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=174">And the fundamental problem is that performance reviews </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=178">and promotion packets and whether or not you get a bonus </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=181">or whether or not you get targeted for a layoff </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=183">or whether or not you can do anything </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=185">is based on what people remember you did. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=188">People as in your boss, your skip, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=191">other peers and yourself, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=193">If no one remembers that something happened, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=194">it's as if you don't get credit for it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=197">And the problem is that without tools, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=200">people really suck at remembering what people do. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=205">The solution is both simple and frustratingly difficult. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=210">It's to record your work and to tell people about it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=213">And this really parallels very closely </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=216">the stuff that Rose was talking about, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=218">Figure out what matters, record whether you're doing it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=221">and then tell people that you're doing it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=224">And that is like a very, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=226">the reason I wanted to do this talk for this one </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=228">is it's a very, very like norm comfy idea. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=230">It's just like record what you're doing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=233">and tell people about it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=235">And the thing is that no one is gonna do this for you. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=239">And some of you, some of you would be probably screaming </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=243">at your screen right now, because you're thinking, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=244">well, I do all my work in, you know, GitHub, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=248">Like, so therefore I could just look back in GitHub </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=250">and see every single thing I did. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=252">The problem is that a lot of the work you end up doing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=256">is actually valuable, but outside of GitHub. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=259">So say if you work in some kind of proprietary system </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=261">off to the side, say you, you know, work in like, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=264">I don't know, like say Snowflakes IDE </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=265">or something like that, it might not appear in GitHub. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=268">Say you end up like actually mentoring someone. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=270">So like someone wants to be a data scientist </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=272">from the ads department, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=273">you've spent a few lunches helping them out </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=275">or something like that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=276">You can actually end up in a situation </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=279">where you aren't getting credit for that work </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=281">because it doesn't appear in your regular tracking thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=285">And the problem is that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=288">because you're the primary beneficiary of this </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=291">and because GitHub is more about like tracking work </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=294">as if like with the goal of completing that work </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=296">for some kind of project, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=297">not tracking your contribution as a whole, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=301">a lot of this stuff can fall by the wayside. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=304">And it means that the one of the best things </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=308">you can do for yourself, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=310">really like just genuinely one of the best things </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=312">you can do for yourself is just record what you do </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=315">and tell people about it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=319">The other thing that comes up is that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=320">some work is just more susceptible to being invisible. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=324">Rose brought up Blue Work, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=325">which is a very classic example of the type of work, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=328">type of work that's very often done by women </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=330">in tech companies that is things that just don't appear </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=334">in many other places, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=337">It would be things like mentorship or talking to customers </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=339">or expanding documentation or some kind of like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=342">one-off project or things like communication. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=345">That it's just, it's easy for that to fall by the wayside </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=348">because it's not naturally tracked in any kind of like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=350">Asana or GitHub or something like that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=354">And so if you do some kind of like ad hoc mentorship </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=357">with someone and no one ever brings it up again, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=359">again, it's as if it's a visible work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=361">It's as if you didn't do it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=362">You're not gonna get credit for it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=364">for any kind of promotion. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=365">And that's wrong. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=366">Like you should fight and get credit for it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=368">You already did the work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=369">You guys will get credit for it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=371">So what can we do? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=373">It's a very complex two-step process. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=376">I sort of joke here, but it's actually like, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=377">it's actually really difficult to do. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=379">And I'll talk to like, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=381">what some of the ways to get around it is. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=383">One, build a really lightweight system </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=386">for tracking your own work and your own lightweight system. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=388">Don't like rely on like the company system </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=391">for tracking your work, like build your own </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=392">that is hosted locally somewhere that you can control. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=396">And then two, tell people about your work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=398">And there's various ways that you can end up doing that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=401">There are lots of ways to end up recording work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=403">And I don't, I, in designing this talk, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=407">I didn't want to focus too much on like specific ways, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=409">like Rose brought up the way that she ends up using. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=413">There's lots of different ways. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=414">I'll talk about a few of them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=415">I'll talk about my own one, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=417">but whatever works for you is fine, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=420">The only real requirements to this thing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=421">is that you like record what you do </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=424">and then be able to like use that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=426">and it'll communicate back to people. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=429">Brag docs, Julie Evans, I think she came up with it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=433">And I want to give her credit for it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=434">because I think she invented it, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=436">but I don't want to like, if there was, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=437">if it actually came up from somewhere else, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=439">I don't want to like jump on their credit. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=442">But that was the first time I read about it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=444">was Julie Evans' work works blog posts. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=449">And the idea behind of a brag document </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=450">is actually super powerful. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=452">So you create this document that inside that document, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=457">you write really polished notes about, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=459">you know, like things that you've accomplished, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=461">And so like you, you know, accomplish some projects, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=465">you mentor some people, whatever it is, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=467">and you write those little nuggets, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=468">like in the document itself. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=470">And then you share those document, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=472">that exact document with your boss </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=476">or with your skip or something like that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=478">And the thing that's very, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=480">that is very appealing about that approach </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=483">is that the thing that you're recording your work in </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=486">is also the thing that you're actually ending up sharing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=489">So your communication pathway using the doc </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=491">is actually the exact same as the way </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=494">that you're recording it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=496">There's tons of resources out there on Brag Docs. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=500">Julia has a template. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=501">There's also, you can literally go to bragdocs.com, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=504">I think, and there's actually like a template there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=506">Like there's tons of really cool things out there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=508">There's lots of Brag Doc templates on GitHub. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=512">It's a great approach. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=514">What I do, because I was never able </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=517">to actually successfully accomplish a true Brag Doc, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=521">is I keep a private activity log. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=524">So instead of having a document </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=527">where I would write what I accomplished </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=530">and, you know, like for some kind of project, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=532">I was always like the idea of writing something </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=535">in a way that was polished enough to share it to my boss </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=538">always kind of made it that I ended up procrastinating </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=541">actually writing down that I did the thing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=542">and then I would forget. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=543">And so it was just like vicious cycle. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=545">So instead I kind of split them up </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=547">where I have a private activity log </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=550">where I just write super messy notes on what I did. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=553">That is sort of the like really, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=555">super messy one line kind of notes, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=557">mostly just to jog my memory later on that I did something. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=561">The example on the second half of the slide </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=564">is a real example of my activity log. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=568">I've changed like some dates and blah, blah, blah. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=570">But like, basically this is what it looks like. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=571">It's just hundreds of lines like this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=574">And I'm adding lines, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=576">I'm adding like two or three lines like a day, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=578">every single day, just dumping them in. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=581">And I don't think all those lines would really like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=584">reach the level of brackiness. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=586">I don't know what to put. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=587">Really like reach that level of, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=590">wanting to like show that to people. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=591">But I'm just like dumping anything </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=593">that I think might be useful for the, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=597">for the future that I can use it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=600">Then the second part, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=602">which is that there's lots of ways </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=604">to tell people about your work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=606">And I think the thing that was difficult for me </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=612">with the Brag Doc was that a lot of times, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=616">like the way that organizations communicate </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=620">their performance and communicate like the work that you did </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=623">is often like weirdly formal. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=625">So at the Wikimedia Foundation, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=628">like in Grant's, Grant was my boss </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=630">at the Wikimedia Foundation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=631">We'd have like a separate thing, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=632">like every quarter I would like paste what I did </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=636">into betterworks.com. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=639">That was where I paste it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=640">And so like, it didn't really work </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=642">with the Brag Document format, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=643">cause I would have to like take it out </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=644">and put it into this like separate third-party SaaS platform </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=648">to show my work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=651">And so, you know, to me, I think like, of course, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=655">like using the internal places of reporting work, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=659">like we used better works, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=660">so I would put it into better works. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=662">Written is way better than doing it verbally </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=666">because you remember things longer if it's written </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=669">and you can refer it back to them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=670">But I don't think you should like discount </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=672">the just informal, like bringing up </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=675">that you did something, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=676">Like if you're having like a casual one-on-one </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=678">with your manager, glance through your doc </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=681">and make sure you say some of the things </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=682">that you think might be interesting, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=684">Like just like, it's, I wouldn't like formalize everything </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=687">to the point where like the only way </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=690">that you're talking about your work </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=691">is through like this one document. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=692">I would just be like, I have tons of ammunition </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=694">in my activity log and I'm just like hammering them out </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=697">through every medium possible. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=698">I'm talking about it on Slack, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=700">I'm writing a weekly update to the whole staff </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=703">where I'm putting things in there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=705">I'm talking about it in weekly one-on-ones verbally, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=708">I'm putting it into like a one-on-one note doc </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=710">if I have like whatever I can, I'm like pushing it out there </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=713">that I'm doing this kind of stuff. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=716">The one that's kind of like incredibly impressive </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=719">and I think I would like to do more of </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=723">is blog posts and newsletters. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=725">So there was this person who worked at Slack </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=728">and I won't name her, but she was really accomplished </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=731">at Slack and an amazing person. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=733">And one of the things that she talked about </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=737">sort of in like a private meeting </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=740">was that like by putting stuff out there </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=743">in blog posts and newsletters, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=745">you know, like here's this cool project we did, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=747">here's all the work I did on it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=748">and that kind of stuff, like a project on your, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=750">like on a blog post on your personal blog, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=752">you are in a way communicating it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=754">in a way that you can then refer to later. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=756">And so like even things like writing stuff </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=758">for this audience is actually a way </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=762">for you to communicate out that you're doing stuff, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=765">which is just super valuable. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=767">And it, you know, we talk about things like Brad documents </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=771">or activity log in terms of like promotion </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=775">for your current job. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=776">So think about it in terms of job security, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=778">but there's a huge benefit to actually just telling </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=781">the world that you're doing stuff. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=783">Like if you're doing some super cool, I don't know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=786">like some super cool new Kubernetes thing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=788">or something like that, like, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=792">like record that stuff in your activity log, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=793">write a blog post about it and put it out into the world. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=796">And like, you get, you will get credit for that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=799">in ways that are really interesting. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=800">You'll get, you know, someone when you're applying for a job, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=802">someone will look at your personal site, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=804">see the kind of stuff that you're doing, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=805">think it's super interesting, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=807">and then you'll sort of advance the next round </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=808">or something like that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=809">And it's just, it's really useful, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=811">but you're not gonna be able to do that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=812">if you're not sort of recording for yourself </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=814">like what you do. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=816">The other one is that you should definitely </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=818">keep personal access to the things. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=821">Don't just rely on the internal customer company systems. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=825">I say that because honestly, like no joke, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=828">the best place to put like your activity log </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=832">or what you're doing, like the most easiest place, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=835">and it's wonderful, is if your company uses Slack, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=838">just use your own Slack channel, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=841">like direct message yourself on Slack. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=843">That's like, it's timestamped, it's awesome, it's amazing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=846">But if you lose access to Slack, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=848">you're gonna lose access to all that information. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=849">So like, I don't use that even though it's so nice </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=852">and easy and simple to use, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=855">but you really do wanna make sure that like, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=857">whatever happens, right, you can do it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=859">And I actually messaged in our Slack for this conference </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=863">that like the Brag Doc or Activity Log </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=866">or whatever you wanna do is a tool </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=869">for you to build your resume. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=870">Like if you lose your job </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=871">and you need to like update your resume, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=873">all of a sudden you have, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=875">this huge record of what you've done, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=877">and you can sift through it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=878">and find some really interesting stuff. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=881">The goal for this whole thing is if someone asks your boss </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=886">or like someone asks a recruiter or something like, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=889">what have you done? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=890">They have that deep well of examples to choose from. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=894">And actually, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=894">Rose brought up this like really great point </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=897">that I think people overlook, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=899">that as a manager, I know that there are times </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=904">that I'm advocating for a staff member </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=906">or like one of my reports, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=909">and then the report doesn't know that, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=911">There's some like special project that's coming up </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=913">and I want them to be the one doing it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=915">And someone's like, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=917">oh, I don't know if they're the right person. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=918">And like, if I have that, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=921">like if I can dig through those notes </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=923">and those Brag Docs for them or whatever they have listed, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=925">like I can bring up all these great examples. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=927">If I remember all those great examples, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=928">if I can look through their, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=930">like formal, like, you know, letters that they're writing, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=932">like weekly updates or whatever that they're writing, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=935">I can use that as ammo for like an argument. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=937">And their actual report who wrote them, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=939">like doesn't even know that I'm doing this, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=941">But like, it's important, it's important. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=943">And if you have a good manager, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=944">that manager is advocating for you. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=946">And it's great to give them that kind of ammunition </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=949">that they can use, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=949">even though if you end up not seeing it in any, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=952">like you don't actually know </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=953">that they're doing it at the moment. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=956">That is the end of my talk. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=961">And here's my little, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=961">I'm gonna add this to my own activity log, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=963">gave a presentation at NormConf because, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=967">we should all track our work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=969">And I definitely think probably the most normy thing to do </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=971">is just to take credit for what we do, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiF83i1OLOM&t=974">because what we do is pretty freaking awesome. </a>
