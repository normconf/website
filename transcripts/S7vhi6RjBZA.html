        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=0">What I'm here to talk about is a group by statements </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=4">that will save the day, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=7">which I thought was going to be an interesting topic. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=10">So what I would like to do is explain </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=11">what this talk is about, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=13">but I also want to explain who the talk is for, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=15">because in my mind, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=17">there are people like Alice and Bob and Factorella </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=21">that are interested in maybe getting started </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=23">in this field of stuff with data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=25">It's a very attractive field. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=27">And maybe Alice and Bob are recent graduates. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=29">Maybe they're just interested in a career transition, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=33">but it's been a while since I was a beginner. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=34">So I was thinking, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=35">what is it like to maybe start out now? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=37">And then you give it a Google </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=39">and then you read stuff like, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=40">hey, data drives everything </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=42">and you need to get the skills you need </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=45">for the future of work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=47">And there are these listicles of like 10 essential skills </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=51">for data scientists. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=53">And if you really try hard, I mean, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=55">you will even find like the best data science </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=58">certificate programs from a bootcamp </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=61">that I will not name here, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=63">but people are very eager to take your money </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=65">so they can give you a certificate. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=67">And, you know, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=68">and that kind of brings me to the topic of this talk </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=71">because what I want to talk about in this talk </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=73">is two stories of two datasets. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=75">These two datasets are properly beautiful </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=78">because they both tell a story, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=80">but the reason why they're beautiful </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=81">is also because it's a story that I think </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=83">Alice and Bob and Vectorella really need to hear. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=88">It is a story to help remind everyone </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=90">of the human aspect of this data work that we're doing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=93">And hopefully it's also a story </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=94">that might help remove some anxiety </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=96">against this whole must-have skills phenomenon </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=99">that I'm becoming increasingly frustrated with </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=101">on the internet. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=103">So with that out of the way, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=105">let's talk about a beautiful dataset. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=107">The first dataset I want to talk about </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=109">is called ChickWaite. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=111">ChickWaite comes with the language R. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=113">So if you install R, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=114">you can call this variable ChickWaite </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=116">and you actually get this dataset. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=117">It comes with the language. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=118">It's a neat feature. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=120">And this dataset has a couple of columns. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=123">So one column is chick, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=125">the other one's time, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=126">the other one's weight. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=127">And the idea here is that the chicken number one </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=130">at time step zero had a certain weight. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=132">And as time moves on, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=134">the weight also increases. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=136">But this chicken also had a diet. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=140">This chicken got a specific kind of food. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=143">And different chickens might have different kinds of food, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=146">but you can imagine that there's kind of a use case here </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=148">where it's kind of like an A-B test. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=150">We're trying to figure out which diet is best </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=152">for the chickens to get them to grow. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=155">And if you're the good data science person </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=158">that you're supposed to be, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=159">you do some exploratory work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=160">So you make a chart and you kind of get this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=163">On the X-axis, you've got time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=165">On the Y-axis here, you've got weight. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=167">And you can see that there's this general pattern </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=170">in the middle over here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=171">You can definitely see the average is going up, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=174">but you can also see that there's a bit of variance. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=177">There's actually quite a bit of spread here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=179">And that is something that you can totally see. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=181">But then you can do sort of the clever group by. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=184">And what you then notice is that when you group by the time </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=188">as well as the diet, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=189">you can kind of make a summary line for each diet. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=191">And you can also see that some of these diets </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=193">perform better than others. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=194">It's like something that you can conclude. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=196">Ah, but now come the data machine learning people. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=201">And they say, we have these tools for the future of work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=204">These are tools that you really want to use and apply. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=206">So I can imagine the pressure, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=208">Like you're doing analysis here, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=209">but you need to wiggle a tool in here </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=211">that's supposedly the future of work. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=214">And these are good tools by the way, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=215">but like I can imagine that there's this pressure. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=217">So then immediately your mind kind of goes like, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=219">maybe I need to do something predictive here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=222">And you can actually come up </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=223">with a reasonable use case for that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=225">You can actually say, well, given a diet and the time, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=227">maybe we can predict the growth trajectory </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=229">for these chickens. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=230">And it's actually kind of a reasonable thing you could do. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=234">But you can also just wonder, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=237">well, is that the thing we should do? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=240">Like, should we immediately think about the modeling thing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=243">we want to predict here? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=245">Because maybe that's a distraction. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=247">And I'm about to give you like a very good hint. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=249">Like if you're in data science, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=250">there's one thing people don't do enough of. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=252">And that is that when they make a visualization like this, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=254">you need to take five minutes </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=255">and just stare at the thing for a while. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=258">And you need to look for stuff that might surprise you. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=261">Hadley Wickham has this really great quote, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=263">a machine learning scales very well, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=265">but it doesn't surprise you. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=267">Visualizations don't scale super well, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=268">but they do have the ability to surprise you. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=271">And in this case, if you just squint your eyes a bit, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=275">something fishy is happening here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=278">Notice here, like a time step zero, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=281">It seems that there's a chicken </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=282">that's actually losing weight. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=285">Because if I look at the height, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=287">there's definitely like a chicken here </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=288">that seems to be losing weight. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=290">I don't know which one of these chickens, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=291">But that's a bit off. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=293">And it's not just happening here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=295">It's also happening, well, here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=300">And that's a hint. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=302">So, okay, something weird seems to be happening there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=305">Maybe we shouldn't model just yet. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=306">Maybe we need to think a little bit about that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=308">Maybe we need to do another group by. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=311">And what I'm going to do now </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=312">is I'm going to make the same visualization, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=313">but I'm just going to group by the chicken. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=315">Like I'm going to ignore the diet for now. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=317">Just group by the chicken. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=318">And when you do that, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=319">you get a growth line for each of these chickens. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=321">Let's just go back there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=323">You get a growth line for each of these chickens. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=325">And you can kind of see the trajectory for each of them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=329">And when you then zoom in again </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=330">and you squint your eyes again, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=332">you will notice that a chicken stops here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=336">And another chicken stops there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=338">Another chicken stops there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=340">And if we now zoom out again </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=342">and we just assign a color to the chickens </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=343">that stopped prematurely. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=347">Okay, it seems that some chickens die prematurely. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=349">I don't know for sure, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=350">but that's a hint that I'm getting. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=354">And now if I take a step back and I ask myself, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=356">which of these two charts is more important, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=359">Like even if I'm using the most fancy machine learning tools </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=362">and I'm like displaying all the metrics </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=364">that try to convince you </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=365">of how good the predictive power is, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=368">we have to be very critical here </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=369">because suppose that you have a TensorFlow model </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=373">that's very good at predicting </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=374">like the average diet weight over here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=377">Are we actually sure that it's taking into account </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=380">that some of the chickens might've died? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=383">Unless you are aware that that's the thing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=385">you got a model for, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=386">the model's not gonna know about it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=388">And this, I would argue, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=390">is a really nice example of a group by statement </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=393">that can really save the day. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=394">If you didn't know this upfront, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=396">you might be pushing a model to production </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=399">that predicts dead chickens. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=401">And that will be bad, I think. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=406">So maybe we don't need TensorFlow to save the day. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=410">Maybe we need a certificate for asking the right question </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=415">because that's something we maybe need more of. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=417">It's like a very simple conclusion </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=418">that I have with this dataset. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=422">So, okay, that's just one dataset. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=423">Let's move on to the next one. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=425">Now, this other dataset </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=426">deserves a slightly different introduction </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=428">because I have to talk about this kind of, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=430">I will say, unclear task first </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=433">that's increasingly popular. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=437">So what you can do is you can go to this website </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=439">called HuggingFace. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=440">And HuggingFace has a couple of interesting features. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=441">They host datasets, they host a bunch of models, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=444">but you can also search for these models. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=446">And one way of searching allows you to say, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=448">well, I'm interested in the task of text classification. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=451">That means text goes in and some sort of class comes out. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=455">And you can predict just about anything </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=456">like topic of a newspaper article and whatnot. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=459">But apparently in the top five, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=461">like most downloaded models on text classification, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=466">four or five are about sentiment, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=469">which is basically saying text goes in </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=471">and out goes positive or negative. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=475">But then you start wondering, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=476">like how do I interpret positive and negative? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=478">Because that's a pretty big bucket of stuff. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=481">Like I can be in love and I can be laughing, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=484">but those are two quite distinct emotions </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=486">that I don't think we should really pretend </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=488">like they are the same. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=489">That feels a bit strange </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=491">and maybe the same thing for fear and anger. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=493">Like I get that sentiment is like a simple concept, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=497">but it might be too simple as well, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=499">depending on what we're interested in doing with text. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=502">So imagine my delight when around the same time last year, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=506">like about a year ago, a bit longer, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=508">I learned about this dataset called Google Emotions. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=512">They took the effort of actually writing a paper </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=514">and the Google name is attached. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=516">And this is a dataset where we're not doing just sentiment. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=519">No, we're actually doing emotions. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=523">So they took data off of Reddit </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=525">and you've got texts like this, like, oh my God, yep. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=529">That's the final answer. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=530">Thank you so much. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=531">And like, you can attach labels to it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=534">This is not classification, it's more like tagging. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=536">So you can have more than one class attached to this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=540">Let's move a bit of a detail, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=541">but I think it's interesting because it also makes sense. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=544">You can have texts where more than one emotion applies. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=547">So that feels appropriate. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=549">And what you can do here is that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=551">they also did a bit of annotation. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=553">So each example was annotated by at least three people. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=556">Sometimes even five people had to look at it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=559">And you can read the paper </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=560">and read all sorts of interesting details. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=562">So there's about 60, like almost 60,000 text examples, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=567">over 200,000 annotations, 82 people were annotating here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=572">There were 27 emotion tags attached from amusement to joy, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=576">to relief, to nervousness and grief. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=578">I mean, it's a huge pallet of emotions that was covered. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=581">They also made this correlation chart that was interesting. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=584">So you can see that like some emotions co-occur together </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=587">and some don't, some just don't appear together at all. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=590">That's something that the paper did mentioned. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=592">There's also like a lot of effort </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=594">that went into pre-processing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=595">that was pretty interesting to read. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=597">So they removed a couple of subreddits </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=598">just because they were too vulgar, makes sense, Reddit. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=602">But they also masked the name of people </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=604">as well as references to religion. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=606">Seems like a good thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=607">They made sure that each test had at least three tokens </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=611">and no more than 30. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=612">All the annotators were English natives. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=616">So, you know, a bunch of interesting things </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=618">that went into this, bunch of thought. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=620">And then the paper also goes into like benchmark models. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=622">So the deep learning thing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=623">where they all show the confusion matrix. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=626">And it makes sense that certain emotions </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=628">are confused with each other. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=629">And oh, there's also these awesome like F1 charts </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=632">for transfer learning. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=633">And here's where we need to stop again. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=637">Because we can get excited about these charts like before. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=641">Like we can really get the blood pumping. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=644">But what if there are dead chickens in this dataset too? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=647">And that's a question I've been asking myself </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=649">more and more recently. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=653">So usually when you're looking for dead chickens </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=655">in the dataset, it's like a really good exercise to do. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=657">But if you're looking for a good hint, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=659">try to think about how the dataset got created. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=662">Because let me give you a hint. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=664">If you can't use visualization, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=666">how a dataset got created usually gives a good hint too. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=671">So this dataset got created </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=673">because a bunch of people on the internet were annotating. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=676">And if I recall correctly, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=676">I believe the paper mentioned Mechanical Turk. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=679">So it's not just the fact that we have </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=681">many people annotating. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=683">We also have people annotating that aren't in the same room. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=686">You can actually assume that these people </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=687">don't necessarily talk to each other. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=690">And you can kind of wonder, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=691">well, maybe these people occasionally disagree. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=695">That's definitely possible. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=696">Especially when it's emotion, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=698">which is culturally like a thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=700">It's not necessarily universal. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=701">It's language, that's also a thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=703">Oh, and by the way, it's also Reddit data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=706">And that brings in an interesting phenomenon. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=710">So on Reddit, you can have texts like, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=711">oh my God, those tiny shoes desire to, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=714">should be boob snoot, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=715">a desire to boob snoot intensifies. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=717">Like that's a perfectly normal sentence on Reddit. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=721">But I can imagine that if you're like the 25 year old </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=725">or 50 year old trying to parse </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=727">what's actually being communicated here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=729">Like, can we really assume that everyone </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=731">has the same opinion on whether or not </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=733">this is about excitement? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=736">And by the way, this is an actual example from the dataset. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=739">I'm not making this up. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=740">This stuff just naturally appears. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=742">But no, okay, maybe this is grouped by time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=745">Maybe this is one of those things I just need to check </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=747">before I do any sort of modeling on this thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=749">Let's just see if I can come up with a nice little number. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=751">So I group by text and I just check </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=754">whether or not all annotators agree. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=757">On all 27 emotions, by the way, at the same time. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=759">That's the number that I'm calculating here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=762">And there you go. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=763">Out of the 58,000 text examples, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=767">less than 8,000 of them have every annotation </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=770">agree on every emotion. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=772">So it's like 13% of all the examples </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=775">have everyone actually agree on the emotions that are there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=781">That's not a huge number. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=784">But I do want to caveat just a little bit. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=786">So when there are 27 emotions, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=788">if only one of the annotators disagrees </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=790">with one of the emotions, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=792">that also means that there's no agreement </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=793">between all of them, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=794">So it's not like I expected this number to be high. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=797">But I would also expect that if I'm going to do </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=799">machine learning on this, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=800">I do expect this number to be just slightly higher, maybe. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=805">And what's more, you can also do some other </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=807">really interesting group buys here. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=808">So what you can also do is you can say, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=810">let's just look at the top three annotators. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=812">Usually these data sets, by the way, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=814">they come with like a huge skew, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=815">like the top N% has like way more than N% of the annotations. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=820">So in this case, the top three annotators </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=822">annotate about 14% of all the data. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=824">Together, they annotated almost 7,000 examples </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=828">and not even half of them agree with each other. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=831">So this whole disagreement thing, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=832">you didn't need 82 people to discover this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=834">If you just take three people, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=835">it seems that they immediately disagree </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=837">on a lot of this stuff. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=838">And again, I would argue, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=840">this is another example of a group buy statement </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=842">that could really save the day. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=843">Imagine running this, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=845">imagine not running this statistical check up front. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=849">Imagine training a huge group of people </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=851">to do a group buy statement. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=853">Imagine training a huge model on it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=857">Right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=858">And again, it's the same thing, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=859">like which is more important. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=859">And I hopefully don't have to convince too many people. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=863">There's a risk that you're gonna model too early </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=865">if you focus too much on the modeling tools </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=867">that are out there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=869">And just to like really drive this point home, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=871">like the standard data science pipeline, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=873">You start with your data, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=875">you pre-process the thing, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=877">you model the thing, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=878">outcomes on metrics. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=879">And if we like the metrics, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=880">we do the prediction thing. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=882">Well, if your data is not too great, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=885">your predictions are not gonna be too great, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=887">but your metrics can still be super shiny. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=889">Like if people have bad labels, for example, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=892">your accuracy numbers are not gonna prevent you </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=894">from putting bad predictions out there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=898">And I don't necessarily wanna dunk on people, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=900">but I also had a look on the same Hugging Face website. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=903">And it turns out that a whole bunch of people </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=905">trained models on Google Emotions </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=906">and they put them out there. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=908">And some of these models got downloaded </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=911">like 260,000 times. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=915">And you gotta wonder, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=916">like, did they run the group by? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=919">Maybe not. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=921">And I also don't wanna blame them, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=923">If you see a dataset from Google, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=927">you know, that's like had all of this effort being taken in </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=930">and had all the charts, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=931">I could definitely imagine that all of that distracts you </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=934">from thinking about running </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=935">this one little group by statement. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=937">Like, I do think it's a shame </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=939">because people forget how these datasets came to be, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=944">but this whole annotation process that happens before it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=946">is really, really important. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=948">And I do worry that maybe if we're convincing ourselves </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=950">that let's say TensorFlow or Scikit-learn, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=953">if those are the must-have tools, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=954">that maybe we forget about the step back </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=957">that we gotta do once in a while. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=960">And, you know, with that in mind, looking back, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=964">I do gotta admit, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=966">Google Emotions is actually kind of a beautiful dataset </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=968">if you think about it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=970">Like, sure, there's annotated disagreement, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=972">but I also don't wanna dunk on Google Emotions here </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=974">because a part of me actually fell in love with it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=978">Like, for a moment here, right? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=980">How many datasets that are used for public benchmarking </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=983">actually contain the annotator information? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=986">I can't think of a lot of them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=988">And it's a great case study, actually, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=990">if you think about it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=991">And what's more, there are actually </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=993">some really interesting papers being written about this. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=995">There's one paper that I do recommend giving a read. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=998">The title is, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=999">Are We Modeling the Task or the Annotator? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1001">This is about annotator bias. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1003">Turns out if there's like one person </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1005">who has like too many of the annotations </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1007">under the his or her belt, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1008">that's gonna totally bias like the aggregate label </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1012">that might come out. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1013">It's a really good read. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1016">But also, Google Emotions definitely had like </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1018">an almost career-altering effect on me. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1020">Before, I would say, oh my God, super cool, new dataset, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1023">let's try stuff. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1024">But now I like to think I'm a bit more critical. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1027">Before actually putting this in production, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1029">I really start to wonder, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1030">well, maybe there's something wrong with it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1031">At least I should check like some basics. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1035">And it also led me to write a library. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1038">There's a library called Doubt Lab. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1040">It is a relatively simple tool </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1042">with some scikit-learn-based tricks </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1043">to try and find some bad labels in your dataset. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1047">And they're just simple tricks. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1049">They're not necessarily state-of-the-art, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1050">but there's stuff in there that generally is worth a try. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1054">And if you find that there are like some weird labels </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1056">in your dataset, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1057">that's an excellent time to maybe pull the plug </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1059">and say, let's first check our annotator process. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1061">Maybe there's something up with that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1063">That's gonna prevent a whole lot of harm in production. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1066">If you're interested in that, by the way, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1068">like how those tricks work, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1069">the Explosion YouTube channel, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1070">which is again, my employer, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1073">I was able to make some content for that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1074">So if you're interested in like the techniques </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1076">on how to find these bad labels, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1077">definitely check that out. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1080">But then if I sort of pivot back </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1081">to like the topic of the talk, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1083">like if we're gonna be talking about like, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1084">what are the must-have skills here, really? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1088">I mean, I get that you're not gonna be able </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1090">to buy a certificate in common sense. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1093">And I also understand that it's gonna be kind of hard </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1095">to find a bootcamp in critical thinking. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1097">I also don't wanna suggest that these tools are useless. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1100">They're not. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1101">Tools can be super useful, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1104">but maybe at this point in time, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1106">there's too much emphasis on learning these technical tools. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1110">And maybe it will be better </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1112">if we can come up with more content </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1113">that puts emphasis on this human part. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1116">Maybe we just need more anecdotes to share around </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1119">and maybe that's gonna prevent more harm. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1123">So looking back, I hope people look at this and they say, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1125">well, this was indeed a talk about two datasets. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1127">And I also hope that we all agree </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1129">that both of these datasets are actually super beautiful </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1131">because they tell a very beautiful story. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1134">But most of all, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1136">I hope that the story here helps give Alice and Bob </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1139">and Vectorella a sense of calm </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1142">because maybe even if we're Googling, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1145">we should worry less about these must-have </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1146">and essential skills </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1147">because maybe we should just admit tools are just tools. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1150">It's very good to learn some, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1151">but maybe it's more important to just stay aware </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1154">of what you're doing and to be the human in the loop. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1157">And when you do that, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1160">you might just have group by statements that save the day. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1163">And that, if anything else, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1165">is what we need more of in our field. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1167">And I also want to mention this </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1169">because I do get this question a lot. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1170">It's this frustration with educational content </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1173">that actually led me to make CalmCode. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1174">I get this question a bit, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1176">so I figured I might just mention it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1177">It's honestly the fact that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1180">mainly what we maybe should be doing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1182">is just focusing on making educational content </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1184">that are more about tools and thoughts </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1186">that make your professional life just more enjoyable. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1189">And maybe we should be less braggy </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1190">about the tools that we use </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1191">because they're not necessarily super state-of-the-art. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1193">They're all just tricks to help us get through the day. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1196">And I'm mentioning this explicitly </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1197">because a couple of you, dear listeners, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1200">are also content makers yourself. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1201">You do a bit of education. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1203">Try to keep the calm in mind is the only thing I would ask </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1206">because I do think our profession </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1207">will be a whole lot better </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1208">if we stop bragging about the tools </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1210">and we just start sharing anecdotes a bit more. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1213">I do think the field could maybe use a bit more of that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1217">So having said that, thanks for listening. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1219">I hope this was super interesting. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1221">And if I can give one small plug, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1223">so I work for this company called Explosion. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1225">And we have a bunch of cool tools like Spacey. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1227">You might've heard of that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1229">And I can't announce anything just yet, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1231">but I can say there's a bunch of really cool stuff </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1233">in the pipeline. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1234">So like, give us a follow. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1236">Like there's cool stuff coming. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1237">Just wanna mention that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1240">Thanks for listening. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1241">Ask me anything in Slack </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7vhi6RjBZA&t=1242">and I'll be around for the conference today. </a>
