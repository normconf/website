        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=0">Good evening, everyone. My name is Rose Wigley. I'm a senior staff software engineer at Shopify. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=8">Our team likes for me to mention that we are hiring for limited roles. So please check </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=12">out our job page if you're interested. Today, I'm going to start with a story. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=19">Once upon a time, in the land before there was a cloud. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=27">Shortly after Y2K failed to lead to the end of the world. But right as it was starting </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=33">to feel like the end of the world in tech. The first time, that is. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=41">There was a young software engineer working at a startup who wanted a raise. Her name </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=46">was Rose. Yes, that is my name. But in this case, Rose </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=52">also stands for the gigantic pair of rose colored glasses I viewed the world through. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=60">For example, I was so naive, I believed the startup when they told me that all those options </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=67">I should buy outright were going to make me rich. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=71">The type of rich where 21 years in the future, I would be relaxing in my cabin on 500 acres </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=79">instead of madly writing conference slides a week before my talk was due. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=85">Luckily, you'll notice my husband has a very clear pair of glasses. Well, except about </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=92">stock options. We both made that mistake in the beginning. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=97">One day after work, I was venting at how frustrated I was. I had been trying to get my raise for </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=103">some time and still hadn't gotten one. And that's when he asked what seemed like the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=109">absolutely most ridiculous question ever. Have you asked for a raise? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=117">At which point, I looked slightly horrified and said, of course not. I've been working </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=123">really hard and putting in lots of extra hours. Aren't they just supposed to give me one because </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=129">I deserve it? This sums up the look on his face when I said </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=135">that. After recovering, he looked at me and said, okay, please sit down. We need to have </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=142">a talk. And that was the day I learned what now seems </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=148">obvious. It doesn't matter how much you deserve something. If you don't ask for it, you aren't </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=155">going to get it. So why data-driven promotions? Because even </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=164">asking isn't enough. Wikipedia says the adjective data-driven means </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=175">that progress in an activity is compelled by data rather than by intuition or by personal </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=181">experience. How many of us have either had or have heard </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=188">of someone asking for a promotion just to be told? I feel you aren't at that level yet. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=194">But I can't tell you why. I like to imagine this in my best Lumberg voice, but I can't </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=200">do an imitation of it. Something as important as promotions and raises </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=205">should not be left up to someone else's intuition, especially since that's a great way to introduce, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=211">you know, unconscious or even conscious bias into the process. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=217">As an example, a study by MIT Sloan associate professor Daniel Lee found that on average, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=225">women receive higher performance ratings than male employees, but receive 8.3% lower ratings </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=234">for potential. Potential being the exact sort of thing a manager is going to think about </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=239">when deciding on a promotion. If we make our promotions dependent on other </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=245">people's feelings, they are no longer dependent on what we have done and what we can do. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=253">But just like we can't rely on others to automatically give us the promotions we deserve, we also </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=260">can't rely on others to gather the data that shows we deserve them. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=265">Even if you have the absolute best manager in tech, they will not be able to do that. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=272">Managers are busy. And good managers are not looking over your shoulder every single second. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=278">There is only one single person who can talk about everything you have done. And that is </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=285">you. So how do you do that? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=290">Data-driven promotions in three easy steps. Okay. Well, except I'm introverted with a </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=298">strong case of ADHD diagnosed late in life. Maybe not easy. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=305">And if you noticed on my first slide, I have some teenagers. And if you're thinking about </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=310">a promotion, I'm guessing your workday is very full. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=314">And there's those three really important things you just have to go to first. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=319">So how about this? Data-driven promotions in three rather difficult </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=325">to get around to but very important steps. To remember these steps, I have a nice acronym. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=333">What is the first thing you are going to think after working super hard, super long, and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=339">being told by your manager they don't feel like you are ready? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=344">WTF. Or more precisely, first, W, what matters? T, track progress. And F, frame your review. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=361">First, W, what matters? Before we can talk about what matters, we </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=369">first have to talk about what does not matter. If you've never seen Tanya Riley's excellent </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=377">talk on Glue Work, I highly recommend watching it. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=381">Glue Work can be summed up as work that keeps teams running but doesn't directly contribute </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=386">to the product. Things like documentation, unblocking others, tooling, taking notes, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=393">planning team activities. Glue Work is often picked up by women and is often one of the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=399">reasons women will be passed over for a promotion as excellent but not technical enough. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=407">You want to make sure you are mostly doing promotable work and sharing the glue work </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=413">across the team. But what is promotable work? That totally </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=420">depends on your current role and your next role. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=427">To define out exactly what that is, I recommend making yourself a responsibility matrix. Grab </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=434">your favorite spreadsheet software and set it up with three columns. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=438">Column one is going to be for the subheaders or for the headers and subheaders for the </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=444">general areas of responsibility your organization uses to judge your performance. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=452">These categories should cover everything you would be expected to be due both technically, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=458">as a leader, as a teammate. If it's part of what somebody in your job should do, it should </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=464">be covered by one of these. Column two is going to be your put your current </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=470">role on top. And then underneath for each of those headers and subheaders, list out </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=477">the behaviors that are expected under that topic for your current role. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=484">Then for column three, you're going to put in the role you want to be promoted to. And </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=490">repeat column two except for that role instead. You want to cover both of these because at </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=496">many companies, there's a little unwritten or unspoken, sometimes spoken, rule of tech </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=503">that in order to be promoted, you have to show you are already acting at the next level </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=508">or at least doing a lot of the tasks at that level. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=513">You need to know what that is so you can start targeting your tasks appropriately. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=519">If you're lucky, the place where you work has a documented job level expect has already </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=524">documented job level expectations in detail. That will make this task easy. I was able </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=531">to make my personal matrix by literally copying lines out of a company-wide document that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=538">says exactly what is expected at each category for each level. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=544">But what if your company has no documented job level expectations? </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=549">Well, unless you work at a very tiny startup, we have an industry word for that. We call </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=556">it a red flag. If a company can't tell you what you should be doing, how can they possibly </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=562">judge that you are doing it? More practically speaking, that means you have a lot more work </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=569">ahead of you. You still need that responsibility matrix. In fact, it's even more important </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=576">than ever. Before you can work on being promoted, you first have to agree with your manager </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=581">on what that even means. But this means you're going to have to at least start it yourself. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=589">You're going to make a responsibility matrix just like before, but this time you're going </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=594">to have to do a lot of the research. Get online, talk to friends in the industry, look for </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=600">what general industry standards are for each role, both what you want to be and the one </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=606">you're aiming for. Then you need to go to your boss and have a really good conversation </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=612">with them. Show them the information that you've gathered. Let them know that you want </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=617">to work towards this promotion. And most importantly, ask them for their advice on how to build </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=625">out what's missing. Even if you kick off this project, you want to get your boss's buy-in </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=633">on it and contributions as early as possible. Because in the end, they're the one who's </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=638">going to have to agree that this is what these definitions are. At the end, you should both </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=645">have an understanding of what each role looks like. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=652">So now we have a definition of what you should be doing. So we go to the next step, T, track </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=659">your progress. The best thing you can do to track your progress is keep an ongoing brag </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=667">document. This is where you keep track of your accomplishments as you make them. Julia </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=673">Evans has a great blog post on brag documents. I highly recommend reading it. I wish my younger </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=680">self could have read this post years ago. It starts with, there is this idea that if </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=687">you do great work at your job, people will or should automatically recognize that work </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=694">and reward you for it with promotions, increased pay. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? However, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=704">I recommend one variation on the brag document. Remember this responsibility matrix we made </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=710">in step W? Organize your brag document by each subcategory in your responsibility matrix. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=719">Include the descriptions for your current and next role under each header as an easy </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=724">reminder to yourself. Then list out what you have done in each category with the date that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=731">you did it or the date range. Just to remind yourself, drop a star by anything you think </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=737">counts as next level work. Side note, if you had to make a responsibility matrix from scratch </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=745">for step one, make sure that lands on your brag document under something like, help define </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=752">job level expectations for roles at the company. That sounds a lot like a task I would expect </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=759">out of a manager, for example. Occasionally, skim over your brag document. It should become </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=766">obvious where you are clearly meeting your level, the next level, or where you need to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=772">spend some extra time and focus. You want your brag document to be your map of where </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=778">you are and where you need to go. You can use this map in two ways. First, it can point </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=786">you to where you need to focus more time. If there is a category or two where you currently </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=792">do nothing or are even weak for in your current role, then you need to find some work in that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=799">area. However, we do not need to be experts at everything. The brag document can show </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=807">you where your strengths and where your weaknesses lie. For your weaknesses, you can do just </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=813">enough to assure people you have the ability to do the work. Then, focus on your strengths. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=821">So you have a few things you do at a level that knocks it right out of the park. You </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=826">want one or two items that's going to make people go, wait, what do you mean they aren't </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=831">already at that level? Finally, F, frame your review. The funniest thing a manager ever </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=844">said to me during a review was, I was very entertained by your self-reflection. It was </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=851">also one of the more startling things a manager said to me because I wasn't sure what he meant </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=856">at first. What was so entertaining by my self-reflection? It turned out it's because I organized it </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=864">a lot like my brag document. When a review is about to start, when you are planning to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=871">ask for a raise or a promotion, when you just need to check with your manager, take your </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=878">brag document and use it to show what you have done in each category. I will go through, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=886">word it nicer, clean things up, collapse multiple things down into a category. I don't mark, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=894">in this case, the things that are work at the next level. I assume, for starters, that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=900">my manager knows what the next level is and will recognize that. However, I'm also always </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=906">prepared because I have the responsibility matrix. If it looks like my manager is missing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=912">its next level, we can talk about why it counts at that level. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=922">That's it. WTF. W, you want to know what matters. T, you want to track your progress. F, you </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=932">want to frame your review so that you're providing your manager with the information that shows </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=938">why are you ready for the next level. Before we end, I want to stop and talk about two </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=945">final things. First, I want us to pause because this advice makes some assumptions. First, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=956">it assumes you are ready for a promotion. This isn't a check box activity where you </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=964">do one thing under each category and once you've checked off all the items, that means </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=970">you're ready for a promotion. Usually, you have to be working at this level long enough </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=977">to show that you can do this skill repeatedly for your company at the level that's expected. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=986">Just because you put a single check mark in each thing, that does not mean when you go </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=991">to talk to your manager, they're going to be like, okay, we're all set. Now you're going </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=995">to get your promotion. This is part of a process. Second, this assumes you have a good relationship </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1004">with your manager. All of us are in different situations at work. Throughout my career, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1012">I have had amazing managers, I have had average managers, and I've had a few awful managers. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1020">Sometimes you're going to be in a situation where it is not going to matter what you do. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1026">You are going to be stuck dealing with a manager who is not going to promote you. So one thing </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1032">you have to learn is to watch for the red flags in your organization and make sure that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1037">you trust your manager to have your back. Now, having your back doesn't mean just promoting </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1043">you. Having your back means that they're willing to have the conversations with you that are </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1048">tough conversations where they might point out where you still need to work stuff. So </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1053">you need somebody who will look out for you, push you when you're ready, and help you when </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1058">you're not. Second, remember when I mentioned that I'm a mother, an introvert, and have </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1068">diagnosed ADHD? Please don't think because I talk about the system that I have implemented </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1075">even close to perfectly. Last review period, I got so busy, I never even submitted my self-reflection. </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1086">My Brag document is often reconstructed backwards every few months after combing through Slack, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1093">email, Google Docs, and any other source I can find to dig out what have I worked on </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1100">recently and why did I not remember to write it all down this time. Sometimes I've even </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1106">forgotten about it so much to the point where I can't reconstruct it, and I just have to </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1112">kind of declare, just like you'll declare I'm done with this inbox and wipe it to zero, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1118">I'll declare Brag's Doc deletion and start over from scratch. The point I want to make </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1124">is I don't want you to judge yourself if you can't hit this ideal I'm talking about. You </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1131">do not have to do this 100% to get yourself promoted. The goal is to aim for this, and </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1139">any amount of work you can do on this on the way helps. The other goal is to remember that </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1146">part of your job is to prioritize yourself and prioritize the time at work to take care </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1154">of yourself, and that means doing things like documenting your work, talking to your manager </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1160">about it, and making sure they know what you've done a great job at. Thank you. Thank you, </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gzEKQnFSCA&t=1168">Vicki, and thank you everyone at NormComp for a chance to give this talk.
